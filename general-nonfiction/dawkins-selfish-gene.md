### Why are people?

We look at "apparently altruistic" and "apparently selfish" behaviours (irrelevant of motives or consciousness) and their examples in nature. Then we make a bold claim: The fundamental unit of selection should be the gene. This requires a definition of "gene" first.

_Background:_ An apparently altruistic act is one which (seemingly) increases fitness of another at the expense of one's own. Similarly defined is apparently selfish.

### The replicators

A replicator molecule in a primeval soup (today it will be quickly decomposed by bacteria) kick-starts life. Erratic copying results in errors (diversity) and are accumulated through generations. Selection favors longevity, quicker multiplication, faithful copying. Limited resources prompt replicators into competition; some replicators develop protective shells (origin of cell) and later survival machines.

This replicator is an early ancestor of DNA. Whether it evolved to DNA or rather was absorbed (usurped) by another molecule into DNA is another question.

_Discussion:_ In the above passages, a replicator is seemingly considered as living. Is it correct to call it life? That doesn't matter for our study.

### Immortal coils

The length of genetic unit is inversely related to its longevity (for instance, life-span of a chromosome in meiosis is one generation). One may consider selection at different levels (gene, individual, species, group). The seflish gene viewpoint explains surplus DNA paradox.

Individual is short-lived. It is the gene (or genetic unit) that is nearly immortal (through copies that transcend across generations).

_Background:_ The genetic unit can be a cistron or one whole chromosome or anything in between. Meiosis only occurs during production of sex cells. Evolution is a process in which relative frequencies of alleles in a gene pool change. 

### Gene machines

Genes require survival machines (the individual which is a vessel) to survive for their [gene]'s own survival. This chapter deals with behaviors (due to genes). Genes cannot actively control individual's behavior due to time-lags. Thefore, genes that developed senses (to detect rivals, protect self or exterminate rivals), brain (to control the senses and muscles), memory (past experiences) were selected. Unconscious purposive behavior is observed in many species (negative feedbacks in engieering sciences emulate this behavior, e.g., guided missiles). Simulation is a method of predicting the future.

_Question:_ What level of purposiveness defines consciousness? Perhaps when a simulator becomes aware that it is simulating. This is all rather philosophical and requires a definition of awareness (a circular argument).

### Aggression: Stability and the selfish machine

An evolutionarily stable strategy (EES) is one which, if most members of a population adopt it, cannot be bettered by another strategy. An ESS is stable because it is immune to treachery (there may exist other strategies that offer better average pay-off for individuals but are susceptible to treachery and hence are unstable). ESS concept is applicable whenever there is a conflict of interests. Territoriality might be an ESS. For understanding aggression among animals, it is convenient to treat each individual as selfish (this model breaks down when they are relatives because they share a substantial portion of their genes).
