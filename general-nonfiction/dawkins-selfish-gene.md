### Why are people?

We look at "apparently altruistic" and "apparently selfish" behaviours (irrelevant of motives or consciousness) and their examples in nature. Then we make a bold claim: The fundamental unit of selection should be the gene. This requires a definition of "gene" first.

_Background:_ An apparently altruistic act is one which (seemingly) increases fitness of another at the expense of one's own. Similarly defined is apparently selfish.

### The replicators

A replicator molecule in a primeval soup (today it will be quickly decomposed by bacteria) kick-starts life. Erratic copying results in errors (diversity) and are accumulated through generations. Selection favors longevity, quicker multiplication, faithful copying. Limited resources prompt replicators into competition; some replicators develop protective shells (origin of cell) and later survival machines.

This replicator is an early ancestor of DNA. Whether it evolved to DNA or rather was absorbed (usurped) by another molecule into DNA is another question.

_Discussion:_ In the above passages, a replicator is seemingly considered as living. Is it correct to call it life? That doesn't matter for our study.

### Immortal coils

The length of genetic unit is inversely related to its longevity (for instance, life-span of a chromosome in meiosis is one generation). One may consider selection at different levels (gene, individual, species, group). The seflish gene viewpoint explains surplus DNA paradox.

Individual is short-lived. It is the gene (or genetic unit) that is nearly immortal (through copies that transcend across generations).

_Background:_ The genetic unit can be a cistron or one whole chromosome or anything in between. Meiosis only occurs during production of sex cells. Evolution is a process in which relative frequencies of alleles in a gene pool change. 

### Gene machines

Genes require survival machines (the individual which is a vessel) to survive for their [gene]'s own survival. This chapter deals with behaviors (due to genes). Genes cannot actively control individual's behavior due to time-lags. Thefore, genes that developed senses (to detect rivals, protect self or exterminate rivals), brain (to control the senses and muscles), memory (past experiences) were selected. Unconscious purposive behavior is observed in many species (negative feedbacks in engieering sciences emulate this behavior, e.g., guided missiles). Simulation is a method of predicting the future.

_Question:_ What level of purposiveness defines consciousness? Perhaps when a simulator becomes aware that it is simulating. This is all rather philosophical and requires a definition of awareness (a circular argument).

### Aggression: Stability and the selfish machine

An evolutionarily stable strategy (EES) is one which, if most members of a population adopt it, cannot be bettered by another strategy. An ESS is stable because it is immune to treachery (there may exist other strategies that offer better average pay-off for individuals but are susceptible to treachery and hence are unstable). ESS concept is applicable whenever there is a conflict of interests. Territoriality might be an ESS. For understanding aggression among animals, it is convenient to treat each individual as selfish (this model breaks down when they are relatives because they share a substantial portion of their genes).

### Genesmanship

A gene might be able to assist replicas of itself in other bodies. Selfish gene viewpoint explains altruism in kinship. But how do animals detect kinship? In a species whose members do not move around much or whose members move around in small groups, chances are good that any random individual you meet is fairly close kin to you. This could be why altruism is frequent in troops of monkeys and schools of whales. Some genes exploit this kinship-altruism (e.g., cuckoos laying eggs in the nests of other birds). Parental altruism is more common than fraternal altruism. Mother is more likely to care for offsprings than father is. This has to do with index of relatedness and degree of certainty. Similarly maternal grandmother more than paternal grandmother, maternal uncle more than paternal uncle (possibly even father) and so on. There are other factors to altruism: life-expectancy, cost-benefit, etc.

_Background:_ Index of relatedness may be calculated from pidegree graph: $\sum (1/2)^k$ where $k$ is the distance of kinship and the sum accounts for each common ancestor.

### Family planning

To bear, or not to bear children, that is the question of this chapter. Child-bearing is not the same as child-caring. Mammals and birds tend to be good carers. Do members of a group altruistically control childbirth for better future of the group? Territoriality may be a necessary license to childbirth (females wedded to the male's territory rather than to the male). This may control population since the territories are limited. Dominance hierarchy is another factor.

Individual parents practise family planning by optimizing birth rates (to maximize the number of surviving children) rather than restrict them for public good. In this way, birth control may not be altruistic.

_Note:_ Population growth depends on when and how many children they bear.

### Battle of the generations

Do mothers have favortie offsprings? This can happen but is conditional. Ideally, a mother tries to distributes equal investment among all her chidren. A child, however, may want special treatment (at the cost of his siblings) and may accomplish this by lying, deceiving or other means. Genes of offspring are selected for their ability to outsmart their parents; genes of parents are selected for their ability to outsmart their young. Who wins this parent-offspring battle? There is no straight answer and often a compromise is reached.

_Note_: Menopause may have evolved (explainable by selfish gene viewpoint)

### Battle of the sexes

Sex may be defined, across all animals and plants, in this way: male gametes are much smaller and more numerous than female gametes. It is possible to interpret all other differences between the sexes as stemming from this one difference.

Binary sexes may have evolved from isogametic pool. Selfish gene viewpoint explains optimum sex ratio of 1:1 (group selection fails). External fertilization in water is probably how sexual reproduction began. Paternal care is more common in water.

### You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours

Some animals live/flock together. This apparent altruism centers around selfishness of the individuals. For instance, hydrodynamic advantage is probably why fishes school. Selfish gene viewpoint explains Kamikaze behavior and worker class behavior seen in some social insects. At least in the case of ants, bees, and wasps, the workers (sterile) may actually be more closely related to the brood than the queen herself (Hamilton).

Selfish gene viewpoint also explains symbiosis. Reciprocal altruism is an ESS. Since long memory and capacity of individual recognition are well developed in humans, reciprocal altruism might have played an important part in human evolution.

### Memes: The new replicators

Culture (not unique to humans). Cultural evolution is faster, progressive, non-genetic. Meme (unit of imitation) analogue of gene for cultural evolution which is transmitted through imitation (replication). Once the genes have provided survival machines with brains that are capable of rapid imitation, the memes will automatically take over.

Replicators have no foresight. We, humans, have brains to simulate the future in imagination. We may be built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to rebel against the tyranny of our creators (selfish replicators).

### Nice guys finish first

Prisoner's Dilemma abounds in nature. In an iterated Prisoner' Dilemma, Tit-for-Tat strategy (beginning with cooperating move, then mimic opponent's move thereafter) and its variants are often the best strategy (not strictly an ESS but feels like it), however this also depends on what strategies opponents adopt.

### The long reach of the gene

The extended phenotype includes all effects gene has in the world (including effects on other living things). An animal's behavior (or extended phenotype) tends to maximize the survival of the genes for that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.

_Digression:_ Parasites don't need to live inside host. If a parasite transmit its genes to the next generation via the same vehicle as host's genes? If no, then it may likely damage the host.
