### Human Behavior

Experience is what each one of us knows directly and whose basis he interprets other people’s behavior, some experience is conscious and some experience persists as sub-conscious dispositions to determine later experience.

All education is self-education.

Purpose is essential to learning. A child learns better if she knows the object or goal or purpose of her learning and activity.

Imitation is a striking feature of the behavior of people in groups. A child between the ages of two and four imitates everything her older sibling does.

Social activity or learning in groups may facilitate (make the process more effective and faster) or inhibit, as in the case for shy people, the learning process of an individual. The sense of co-operation among members proves to be far more effective than competition in the long run.

Sensitivity varies across invidivuals. A mere expression of the face may do more harm to an individual than a slap in the face in another individual.

### Heredity and Environment

The removal of rats’ tails generation after generation will not yield rats without tails or measurably shorter tails. Defects that do not reach the germ cells are not inherited.

### Growth and Development

Growth is rapid during infancy years (the first few years from birth) and during puberty. Although his heart starts beating before birth, he only starts breathing after he is born. At birth, he has no teeth — he drinks only milk and water, and his heart beats at 140 bpm and gradually decreases to around 72 bpm at adulthood.

Girls mature faster than boys. At ages of 12-14, girls are taller than boys on average. Bigger boys are bossy and bully the smaller boys who are meek and submissive.

Left-handed boys often feel shy, senstitive and reserved. The best time to persuade them, if at all one must, to change from left to right hand is between the age of two and three. Thereafter, the persuasion should never be attempted.

Intellectual growth is rapid during infancy, moderate during childhood and slows down in youth. For formation of meaningful concepts, it is necessary to provide children with large opportunities for varied contact with things.
