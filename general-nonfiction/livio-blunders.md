## _Brilliant Blunders_ by Mario Livio

### Darwin

Darwin did not properly understood genetics (although somewhere Mendel was founding the law of _factors_ from pea experiments). Darwin's theory had big challenges: inability to deal with blended inheritance (which would cancel out mutatic variation across generations), and it required far more evolutionary time period than Kelvin's age of the Earth estimate.

### Kelvin

The age of the Earth—a quantity of importance in theology, geology, biology and physics—was first estimated using scientific methods by Kelvin. His estimate was based on uniform heat conduction and solid homogeneous interior. Geologists (believers of uniformitarianism) and biologists (Darwinism) required a much bigger estimate. Perry proved the age of earth could be much bigger than Kelvin's estimate if one assumed a partially fluid interior and allowed the mantle to convect.

Discovery of radioactivity and nuclear reactions provided new energy source; major revisions were now required for Kelvin's estimate of the age of the Sun.

### Pauling

Pauling gave alpha helix structure of proteins. Avery and his group established that DNA is responsible for turning nonvirulent bacteria into virulent ones; however, other scientists (including Pualing) did not believe that DNA had anything to do with heredity, rather they believed proteins are the inheritance units. While Franklin achieved good x-ray diffraction photos of DNA, Pauling was bent on convincing peeps about the alpha helix structure of proteins. Soon, Pauling got interested in DNA and published a triple helix structure of the DNA.
