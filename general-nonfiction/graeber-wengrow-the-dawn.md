### Farewell to Humanity's Childhood

1. [Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes)'s [_Leviathan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)) founded modern political theory: civil war and brute situation of a [state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature) could be avoided only by a strong, undivided government.
2. A modern-day Hobbesian would argue we lived most of our evolutionary history in tiny bands, who could get along mainly because they shared a common interest ("parental investment"). But even these were in no sense founded on equality. Hierarchy and domination, and cynical self-interest, have always been the basis of human society.
3. The prevalent ‘big picture’ of history—shared by modern-day followers of Hobbes and [Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) alike—has almost nothing to do with the facts. A conceptual shift is required to understand the new information.
4. According to [Fukuyama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama) and [Diamond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond) (and Rosseau), agriculture put an end to human equality which was achieved when we lived in nomadic bands and had no concept of private property.
5. Contrary to Hobbesian concept of selfishness and brutal savagery, there is archaeological evidence for pre-government people being selfless and caring.
6. [Pinker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker) claims that the world is getting better—and it has never been as good before. The western civilization has brought happiness and security. The authors opine that Pinker may not be correct on this—there have been many instances where people chose to be in an earlier state of affairs.
7. Existence of long-distance exchange of goods is not a sufficient indicative of market economy. It could be a trophy quest or other interesting reasons. People generally come up with mundane boring explanations of history. This book attempts to give our ancestors their deserved humanity.
