### Farewell to Humanity's Childhood

1. [Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes)'s [_Leviathan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)) founded modern political theory: civil war and brute situation of a [state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature) could be avoided only by a strong, undivided government.
2. A modern-day Hobbesian would argue we lived most of our evolutionary history in tiny bands, who could get along mainly because they shared a common interest ("parental investment"). But even these were in no sense founded on equality. Hierarchy and domination, and cynical self-interest, have always been the basis of human society.
3. The prevalent ‘big picture’ of history—shared by modern-day followers of Hobbes and [Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) alike—has almost nothing to do with the facts. A conceptual shift is required to understand the new information.
4. According to [Fukuyama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama) and [Diamond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond) (and Rosseau), agriculture put an end to human equality which was achieved when we lived in nomadic bands and had no concept of private property.
5. Contrary to Hobbesian concept of selfishness and brutal savagery, there is archaeological evidence for pre-government people being selfless and caring.
6. [Pinker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker) claims that the world is getting better—and it has never been as good before. The western civilization has brought happiness and security. The authors opine that Pinker may not be correct on this—there have been many instances where people chose to be in an earlier state of affairs.
7. Existence of long-distance exchange of goods is not a sufficient indicative of market economy. It could be a trophy quest or other interesting reasons. People generally come up with mundane boring explanations of history. This book attempts to give our ancestors their deserved humanity.

### Wicked Liberty

8. The Age of Enlightenment in Europe was not without foreign influence—for instance, the idea of governments ruling over a people of common language and culture, run by bureaucrats trained in liberal arts who passed competitive exams were entirely new in Europe but had been prevalent for centuries in China.
9. Native Americans pointed out the lack of individual freedom and equality in European institutions. Debates followed on whether or not freedom and equality are good.
10. Enlightenment thinkers were influenced by Native Americans. Many Europeans came to embrace the ideals of freedom and equality after encounters with the Natives.
11. Thinkers such as Hobbes and Locke concluded that, for better or worse, the state of nature is that of freedom and equality.
12. The Jesuits from Europe, whose goal was to convince the Americans of the superiority of Catholic faith, often acknowledged how rational and clear-sighted the Americans were (some even commented that the Natives were cleverer than them)—they would point out flaws and holes in Christian faith and reasoning.
13. The American savages had far more freedom and equality (which is the expression of freedom) than the Europeans—and their equality is nothing like the "equality below law" had no arbitrary authority.
14. Primitive communism was more apparent in Native American societies than in European ones—likely to help/share bread with other families, etc. Money did not turn into power and the concept of private property is almost non-existent.
