### Lost in the Cosmos

1. [_How to Build a Universe?_] Anecdote of Penzias-Wilson; [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) theory explains early universe; our universe just right (for instance, a change in gravity's power could make the universe collapse or fill with void), thus the possibility of multiple universes and big bangs; possible fates of our universe: open, closed, flat; universe has no center or rather every point is a center?
2. [_Welcome to the Solar System_] Our sun is a slight oddity for most star systems are binary; [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt): a region of the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune, believed to contain many comets (including Halley's), asteroids, and other small bodies made largely of ice; Pluto's moon escaped discovery for so long for it's very dark there (the Sun is a pinhead on Pluto); the most perfect vacuum created by humans is not as empty as interstellar space; aliens likely exist, as given by Drake's equation but encounter very improbable
3. [_The Reverand Evan's Universe_] [Supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova) are very rare, and not all stars undergo supernova explosion; supernova generate enough heat to create heavy elements; about 4.6 billion years ago, gases aggregate to form the Sun, then the planets [[History of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth)] , sometime later a Mars-sized object hit the earth forming the moon (created mostly from earth's crust for it lacks iron?); without carbon dioxide [[greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)], Earth be frozen for Sun was dimmer back then

### The Size of the Earth

4. [_The Measure of Things_] Halley-Newton-Hooke anecdote; Earth, not perfect sphere, flatten at poles due to centrifugal force; [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish) anecdotes: extremely shy, measured the mass of the earth
5. [_The Stone-Breakers_] [James Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hutton) and modern geology, he reasoned that deposits into oceans must be accompanied by uplift (mountains) otherwise the crust would be uniform; [catastrophism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) and [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism) (gradualism) in shaping the Earth
6. [_Science Red in Tooth and Claw_] First [dinosuar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur) bone to be found was also the first to be lost; dinosuars discovered, from fossils; Cope-Marsh discovered several (hundreds?) species of dinosuars (fueled by animosity?); Cope tried to donate his bones as specimen for homo sapiens
7. [_Elemental Matters_] Deals with the birth of chemistry: descended from alchemy; [Carl Scheele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele) (Swedish chemist): the original discoverer of many elements; Newlands's Law of Octaves was widely mocked, Mendeleev turned it into [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_periodic_table); Becquerel discovered radioactivity, Curie couple discovered polonium and radium, Rutherford uses half-life to calculate [age of earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth)? [[radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating)] and found it to be much older than Kelvin's estimate

### A New Age Dawns

8. [_Einstein's Universe_] [Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs)'s theoretical contributions to science; [Michelson-Morley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) experiment on [ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether) because EM waves being waves must require a medium?); Einstein and his contributions, gravity as bending of spacetme; [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) ([blueshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Blueshift) and [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)); Hubble's discovery of galaxies drifting apart hence universe expanding hence big bang?
9. [_The Mighty Atom_] Dalton's atomic theory, first evidence shown by Einstein's paper on Brownian motion; Thomson discovered electron; Rutherford gave (classical) structure of atom (almost an empty space); Chadwick discovered neutron; Bohr postulated quantized energy (and electron orbits) explaining [hydrogen spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series); [nuclear forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force) explain why heavier elements are unstable
10. [_Getting the Lead Out_] [Thomas Midgley Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.) invented [leaded gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead) (insisted it was safe to use), [CFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon); problems of C14 dating: 3% younger, contamination, cannot measure age of inorganic materials (such as rocks)?; other dating methods and their problems; [Arthur Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Holmes) pioneered the use of [radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating) of minerals; [Clair Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson) developed [U-Pb dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating) method into [Pb-Pb dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93lead_dating), calculated the age of earth (~4.55 bya), encountered and campaigned against [lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning) (lead is not excreted, rather is deposited in bones and blood permanently)
11. [_Muster Mark's Quarks_] [The Standard Model]; the subatomic universe very different (there may be an entirely new universe inside an electron? Carl Sagan suggests); methods for measuring the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe); existence of [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter); universe's expansion is accelerating indicating [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)
12. [_The Earth Moves_] [Alfred Wegener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener) propounded [continental drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift) theory in early 20th-cen (gave [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea)-hypothesis) and was rejected; evidences began to pile up (e.g., [Mid-Atlantic Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge)) [[Seafloor spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading)]; the name "continental drift" was dropped when geologists realized the whole crust is in motion, hence "[plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics)"; Earth is the only rocky planet to have plate tectonics; there are surface features that plate tectonics cannot explain
