### Lost in the Cosmos

1. [_How to Build a Universe?_] Anecdote of Penzias-Wilson; [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) theory explains early universe; our universe just right (for instance, a change in gravity's power could make the universe collapse or fill with void), thus the possibility of multiple universes and big bangs; possible fates of our universe: open, closed, flat; universe has no center or rather every point is a center?
2. [_Welcome to the Solar System_] Our sun is a slight oddity for most star systems are binary; [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt): a region of the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune, believed to contain many comets (including Halley's), asteroids, and other small bodies made largely of ice; Pluto's moon escaped discovery for so long for it's very dark there (the Sun is a pinhead on Pluto); the most perfect vacuum created by humans is not as empty as interstellar space; aliens likely exist, as given by Drake's equation but encounter very improbable
3. [_The Reverand Evan's Universe_] [Supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova) are very rare, and not all stars undergo supernova explosion; supernova generate enough heat to create heavy elements; about 4.6 billion years ago, gases aggregate to form the Sun, then the planets [[History of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth)] , sometime later a Mars-sized object hit the earth forming the moon (created mostly from earth's crust for it lacks iron?); without carbon dioxide [[greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)], Earth be frozen for Sun was dimmer back then

### The Size of the Earth

4. [_The Measure of Things_] Halley-Newton-Hooke anecdote; Earth, not perfect sphere, flatten at poles due to centrifugal force; [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish) anecdotes: extremely shy, measured the mass of the earth
5. [_The Stone-Breakers_] [James Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hutton) and modern geology, he reasoned that deposits into oceans must be accompanied by uplift (mountains) otherwise the crust would be uniform; [catastrophism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) and [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism) (gradualism) in shaping the Earth
6. [_Science Red in Tooth and Claw_] First [dinosuar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur) bone to be found was also the first to be lost; dinosuars discovered, from fossils; Cope-Marsh discovered several (hundreds?) species of dinosuars (fueled by animosity?); Cope tried to donate his bones as specimen for homo sapiens
7. [_Elemental Matters_] Deals with the birth of chemistry: descended from alchemy; [Carl Scheele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele) (Swedish chemist): the original discoverer of many elements; Newlands's Law of Octaves was widely mocked, Mendeleev turned it into [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_periodic_table); Becquerel discovered radioactivity, Curie couple discovered polonium and radium, Rutherford uses half-life to calculate [age of earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth)? [[radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating)] and found it to be much older than Kelvin's estimate

### A New Age Dawns

8. [_Einstein's Universe_] [Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs)'s theoretical contributions to science; [Michelson-Morley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) experiment on [ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether) because EM waves being waves must require a medium?); Einstein and his contributions, gravity as bending of spacetme; [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) ([blueshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Blueshift) and [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)); Hubble's discovery of galaxies drifting apart hence universe expanding hence big bang?
9. [_The Mighty Atom_] Dalton's atomic theory, first evidence shown by Einstein's paper on Brownian motion; Thomson discovered electron; Rutherford gave (classical) structure of atom (almost an empty space); Chadwick discovered neutron; Bohr postulated quantized energy (and electron orbits) explaining [hydrogen spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series); [nuclear forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force) explain why heavier elements are unstable
10. [_Getting the Lead Out_] [Thomas Midgley Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.) invented [leaded gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead) (insisted it was safe to use), [CFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon); problems of C14 dating: 3% younger, contamination, cannot measure age of inorganic materials (such as rocks)?; other dating methods and their problems; [Arthur Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Holmes) pioneered the use of [radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating) of minerals; [Clair Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson) developed [U-Pb dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating) method into [Pb-Pb dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93lead_dating), calculated the age of earth (~4.55 bya), encountered and campaigned against [lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning) (lead is not excreted, rather is deposited in bones and blood permanently)
11. [_Muster Mark's Quarks_] [[The Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)]; the subatomic universe very different (there may be an entirely new universe inside an electron? Carl Sagan suggests); methods for measuring the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe); existence of [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter); universe's expansion is accelerating indicating [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)
12. [_The Earth Moves_] [Alfred Wegener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener) propounded [continental drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift) theory in early 20th-cen (gave [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea)-hypothesis) and was rejected; evidences began to pile up (e.g., [Mid-Atlantic Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge)) [[Seafloor spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading)]; the name "continental drift" was dropped when geologists realized the whole crust is in motion, hence "[plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics)"; Earth is the only rocky planet to have plate tectonics; there are surface features that plate tectonics cannot explain

### Dangerous Planet

13. [_Bang!_] The [K-Pg boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_boundary) (formely K-T boundary) is a thin band of rock containing much more [iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium) than other bands; its age is usually estimated at 66 Ma; is associated with [Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event), a mass extinction which destroyed a majority of the world's [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic) species, including all [dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur) except for birds; every year the Earth accumulates some 30,000 tonnes of space dust, containing exotic elements not normally found on earth (e.g. iridium, which is much more abundant in space because most of Earth's iridium is thought to have sunk to the core when the planet was young); [Walter Alvarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Alvarez) and [Luis Alvarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Walter_Alvarez) developed [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis) that dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid impact
14. [_The Fire Below_] [Richter scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_scale) is a logarithmic scale that measures strength of [earthquates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake), but says nothing about damage; most common are [interplate earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplate_earthquake): as they push each other, pressure build up until one or the other gives way (longer intervals between quakes produce more pressure, hence stronger quakes?) see [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), which stands at the meeting point of three plates; less common type can happen almost anywhere [[intraplate earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraplate_earthquake)]; restiveness of animals before earthquakes is a fact, not well understood; rocks flow inside earth like glass flow under gravity; high pressure at [Earth's core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_Earth) presses any rock into solid; bodies without liquid core (Moon, Mars) do not have magnetism; [Earth's magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field) changes over time, sometimes reverses [[geomagnetic reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal)]; currently diminishing, not a good sign, since it protects us from [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) from space, without which they would tear bodies and leave DNA in useless shreds ([Auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora) are also caused by Earth's magnetism)
15. [_Dangerous Beauty_] [Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano) may involve [mountain-building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_formation) (see [Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) or [Kilimanjaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro)) or result in a [caldera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera); [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park) is an active [supervolcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano) (seems swelling again), sitting on top of an enormous hot spot [[superplume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superswell)], a reservoir of molten rock, the heat whence powers vents, geysers, hot springs [[Grand Prismatic Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prismatic_Spring)] (also check [[Deccan Traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps)]); superplumes may be responsible for the rifts that cause continents to break up; last supervolcano eruption on Earth was at [Toba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngest_Toba_eruption) some 74,000 years ago, thought to have carried [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngest_Toba_eruption#Possible_effects_on_Homo) right to the brink of extinction, no more than a few thousands survived, explaining our lack of genetic diversity; [Tetons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton_Range) (south of Yellowstone) have been formed by continuous big earthquakes, are about the most overdue earthquake zone now; [extremophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) live (or thrive) in [extreme environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_environment), [thermophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermophile)—a type of extremophile—live in high temperatures and are found in various [geothermally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy) heated regions, such as hot springs like the Grand Prismatic Spring

### Life Itself

16. [_Lonely Planet_] [[Underwater exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_exploration)] diving a challenge due to [water pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_pressure); divers have to deal with the problem of [decompression sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness) (bends)—either by very short exposure to pressure changes or ascend by careful stages [[J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane)]; nitrogen becomes powerful intoxicant beyond 30 metres depth; Earth is favorable for life: excellent location (compare with [Venus](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus) or [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mars)), molten interior giving magnetism, twin planet (considering [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) which is slipping away), good timing; Earth seems accommodating because we evolved to suit its conditions: an alien might find it almost inhabitable, elements that don't occur naturally on Earth are toxic to us.
17. [_Into the Troposphere_] [Troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere) contains most of [atmospheric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth) mass, virtually all water and weather; right above it is [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer) in [stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere) which is warmer, then it becomes cold in [mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere); if an incoming vehicle hit [thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere) at too shallow an angle, it could bounce back into space; [Death Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_zone) causes bodily distress; [convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection) moves air in the atmosphere; uneven distribution of solar heat causes difference in air pressure leading to [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind); water's high [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity) causes delay in actual feeling that a season has started; marine organisms keep Earth stable and cool by capturing atmospheric carbon (as $CO_2$) from rain, uses it to make shells, diminishing greenhouse effect, when they die, they fall to seabed and turn into [limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone), later feeding volcanos and returning to atmosphere (a long [carbon-cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle))
18. [_The Bounding Main_] Ice's lower density than water causes ocean not to freeze entirely (possibly forever); proportions of salts and minerals in our tissues uncannily similar to those in sea water (_we sweat and cry in seawater_) but cannot handle them as input as too much intake of salt causes cell [dehydration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration) (to balance out the salinity); [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level) is a notational concept, sea not level at all; [chemosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosynthesis): a life without sunlight, oxygen: large organisms around [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent) off [Galapagos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands) feeding on bacteria that derive their energy from $H_2 S$ which were being poured steadily from the vents; these deep-sea vents are reason why oceanic salinity does not increase; most aquatic life prefer shallow water: warmth, light, abundance of organic matter to prime the food chain
19. [_The Rise of Life_] [Miller-Urey experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment) of creating amino acids probably does not mimic [early atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Evolution_of_Earth's_atmosphere), which was a less reactive blend of $N_2$ and $CO_2$; life may have been inevitable (life arose as soon as conditions became appropriate); [formation of polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer#Synthesis) should be unfavorable in aquatic media as they involve dehydration linkages (another puzzle of life); Earthly life brought by meteorite? [[Panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia)]; whatever prompted life to begin, it happened just once?; ancient [Archaean world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean) had little oxygen (Mars-like) and was full of noxious vapors from $HCl$ and $H_2 SO_4$; [cynobacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria) invented [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis), trapped hydrogen from water releasing oxygen; only bacteria inhabited Earth for 2 billion years, until oxgen level increased to almost-present level; oxygen is very toxic in [anaerobic world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_organism); oxygen was more efficient for energy production and vanquished competitor organisms; mitochondrial invasion [endosymbiotic event](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiosis) made complex life possible, [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) arrived suddenly in fossil record (check out [[history of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_life)])
20. [_Small World_] [Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria)—almost ubiquitous, more of them in us than human cells, many vital to life [[nitrogen-fixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation)]; supply major portion of breathable oxygen; rapid evolution and one genetic pool [[bacterial conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_conjugation)]; [long life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-living_organisms#Microorganisms) and survivability in extreme conditions: extreme temperature, [moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reports_of_Streptococcus_mitis_on_the_Moon), [acidophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidophile), [deep biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_biosphere), [radioresistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioresistance), radioactive waste [[polyextremophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile#Classifications)]; [Woese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Woese) defined [Archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea) ([domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology))), re-drew [tree of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)#Developments_since_1990); infectious organisms love [mosquitoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease); bacteria may be infected by [bacteriophages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage) (a [virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus)); many ailments (incl. [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenic_bacteria), [ulcer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori), etc.) have bacterial origin; [epidemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic) may return (possibly waiting a new human generation) (check out [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), [slime moulds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold), [necrotizing fasciitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_fasciitis), [taxonomic rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank))
21. [_Life Goes On_] [Fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil)—very rare (the organism must become covered by [sediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment) soon after death, otherwise the remains are destroyed by [scavengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger) or [decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_decomposition)), skewed toward [marine life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life) mostly shallow water [[fossilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil#Fossilization_processes)]; [trilobites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite) appeared during [Cambrian explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) and vanished in [Permian extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event) [[mass extinction events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event)]; some extermination during Precambrian-Cambrian boundary possible; Cambrian saw high diversity of life, most structures today were created back then?; Cambrian more of an increase in size rather than body types?
22. [_Goodbye to All That_] [Lichens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen) may grow where nothing else grows (say [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica)), are slow-growing and last long; more complex lifeforms go extinct quicker?; [sharks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark) haven't changed much since its emergence; to a first approximation, all species are extinct; [KT event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) (more powerful than one Hiroshima-sized bomb for every person alive today) didn't not wipe out life; humans still here because of flukes?
23. [_The Richness of Being_] [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) formalised [binomial nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature), was very comfortable in his own greatness (thought he was the greatest botanist and zoologist who ever lived, his classification was the greatest achievement in the realm of science, and suggested that his gravestone should bear the inscription 'Prince of Botanists') and was preoccupied with sex (for instance, named [Clitoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoria)); most living things are small and overlooked (check out [list of taxa named after human genitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_taxa_named_after_human_genitals))
24.
