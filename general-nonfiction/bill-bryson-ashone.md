### Lost in the Cosmos

1. [_How to Build a Universe?_] Anecdote of Penzias-Wilson; [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) theory explains early universe; our universe just right (for instance, a change in gravity's power could make the universe collapse or fill with void), thus the possibility of multiple universes and big bangs; possible fates of our universe: open, closed, flat; universe has no center or rather every point is a center?
2. [_Welcome to the Solar System_] Our sun is a slight oddity for most star systems are binary; [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt): a region of the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune, believed to contain many comets (including Halley's), asteroids, and other small bodies made largely of ice; Pluto's moon escaped discovery for so long for it's very dark there (the Sun is a pinhead on Pluto); the most perfect vacuum created by humans is not as empty as interstellar space; aliens likely exist, as given by Drake's equation but encounter very improbable
3. [_The Reverand Evan's Universe_] [Supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova) are very rare, and not all stars undergo supernova explosion; supernova generate enough heat to create heavy elements; about 4.6 billion years ago, gases aggregate to form the Sun, then the planets [[History of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth)] , sometime later a Mars-sized object hit the earth forming the moon (created mostly from earth's crust for it lacks iron?); without carbon dioxide [[greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)], Earth be frozen for Sun was dimmer back then

### The Size of the Earth

4. [_The Measure of Things_] Halley-Newton-Hooke anecdote; Earth, not perfect sphere, flatten at poles due to centrifugal force; [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish) anecdotes: extremely shy, measured the mass of the earth
5. [_The Stone-Breakers_] [James Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hutton) and modern geology, he reasoned that deposits into oceans must be accompanied by uplift (mountains) otherwise the crust would be uniform; [catastrophism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) and [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism) (gradualism) in shaping the Earth
6. [_Science Red in Tooth and Claw_] First [dinosuar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur) bone to be found was also the first to be lost; dinosuars discovered, from fossils; Cope-Marsh discovered several (hundreds?) species of dinosuars (fueled by animosity?); Cope tried to donate his bones as specimen for homo sapiens
7. [_Elemental Matters_] Deals with the birth of chemistry: descended from alchemy; [Carl Scheele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele) (Swedish chemist): the original discoverer of many elements; Newlands's Law of Octaves was widely mocked, Mendeleev turned it into [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_periodic_table); Becquerel discovered radioactivity, Curie couple discovered polonium and radium, Rutherford uses half-life to calculate [age of earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth)? [[radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating)] and found it to be much older than Kelvin's estimate

### A New Age Dawns

8. [_Einstein's Universe_] [Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs)'s theoretical contributions to science; [Michelson-Morley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) experiment on [ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether) because EM waves being waves must require a medium?); Einstein and his contributions, gravity as bending of spacetme; [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) ([blueshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Blueshift) and [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)); Hubble's discovery of galaxies drifting apart hence universe expanding hence big bang?
9. [_The Mighty Atom_] Dalton's atomic theory, first evidence shown by Einstein's paper on Brownian motion; Thomson discovered electron; Rutherford gave (classical) structure of atom (almost an empty space); Chadwick discovered neutron; Bohr postulated quantized energy (and electron orbits) explaining [hydrogen spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_spectral_series); [nuclear forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force) explain why heavier elements are unstable
10. [_Getting the Lead Out_] [Thomas Midgley Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.) invented [leaded gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead) (insisted it was safe to use), [CFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon); problems of C14 dating: 3% younger, contamination, cannot measure age of inorganic materials (such as rocks)?; other dating methods and their problems; [Arthur Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Holmes) pioneered the use of [radiometric dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating) of minerals; [Clair Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson) developed [U-Pb dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating) method into [Pb-Pb dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93lead_dating), calculated the age of earth (~4.55 bya), encountered and campaigned against [lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning) (lead is not excreted, rather is deposited in bones and blood permanently)
11. [_Muster Mark's Quarks_] [The Standard Model]; the subatomic universe very different (there may be an entirely new universe inside an electron? Carl Sagan suggests); methods for measuring the [age of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe); existence of [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter); universe's expansion is accelerating indicating [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)
12. [_The Earth Moves_] [Alfred Wegener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener) propounded [continental drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift) theory in early 20th-cen (gave [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea)-hypothesis) and was rejected; evidences began to pile up (e.g., [Mid-Atlantic Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge)) [[Seafloor spreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading)]; the name "continental drift" was dropped when geologists realized the whole crust is in motion, hence "[plate tectonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics)"; Earth is the only rocky planet to have plate tectonics; there are surface features that plate tectonics cannot explain

### Dangerous Planet

13. [_Bang!_] The [K-Pg boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_boundary) (formely K-T boundary) is a thin band of rock containing much more [iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium) than other bands; its age is usually estimated at 66 Ma; is associated with [Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event), a mass extinction which destroyed a majority of the world's [Mesozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesozoic) species, including all [dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur) except for birds; every year the Earth accumulates some 30,000 tonnes of space dust, containing exotic elements not normally found on earth (e.g. iridium, which is much more abundant in space because most of Earth's iridium is thought to have sunk to the core when the planet was young); [Walter Alvarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Alvarez) and [Luis Alvarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Walter_Alvarez) developed [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis) that dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid impact
14. [_The Fire Below_] [Richter scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_scale) is a logarithmic scale that measures strength of [earthquates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake), but says nothing about damage; most common are [interplate earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplate_earthquake): as they push each other, pressure build up until one or the other gives way (longer intervals between quakes produce more pressure, hence stronger quakes?) see [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), which stands at the meeting point of three plates; less common type can happen almost anywhere [[intraplate earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraplate_earthquake)]; restiveness of animals before earthquakes is a fact, not well understood; rocks flow inside earth like glass flow under gravity; high pressure at [Earth's core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_Earth) presses any rock into solid; bodies without liquid core (Moon, Mars) do not have magnetism; [Earth's magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field) changes over time, sometimes reverses [[geomagnetic reversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal)]; currently diminishing, not a good sign, since it protects us from [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) from space, without which they would tear bodies and leave DNA in useless shreds ([Auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora) are also caused by Earth's magnetism)
15. [_Dangerous Beauty_] [Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano) may involve [mountain-building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_formation) (see [Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji) or [Kilimanjaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro)) or result in a [caldera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera); [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park) is an active [supervolcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano) (seems swelling again), sitting on top of an enormous hot spot [[superplume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superswell)], a reservoir of molten rock, the heat whence powers vents, geysers, hot springs [[Grand Prismatic Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prismatic_Spring)] (also check [[Deccan Traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps)]); superplumes may be responsible for the rifts that cause continents to break up; last supervolcano eruption on Earth was at [Toba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngest_Toba_eruption) some 74,000 years ago, thought to have carried [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngest_Toba_eruption#Possible_effects_on_Homo) right to the brink of extinction, no more than a few thousands survived, explaining our lack of genetic diversity; [Tetons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton_Range) (south of Yellowstone) have been formed by continuous big earthquakes, are about the most overdue earthquake zone now; [extremophile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) live (or thrive) in [extreme environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_environment), [thermophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermophile)â€”a type of extremophileâ€”live in high temperatures and are found in various [geothermally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy) heated regions, such as hot springs like the Grand Prismatic Spring
