### The Coming of the Ship

1. Almustafa, having lived in the city of Orphalese for 12 years, is filled with joy as the ship that will take him home arrives—but is soon stricken with sorrow (_Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets_); nevertheless realizes he has to go (_Yet I cannot tarry longer. The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark,_) and to leave everyone taking only memories (_And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun._)
2. The people of Orphalese gather around him and asks him to stay (_Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in
our midst become a memory_) but _he answered them not_; "seeress" Almitra, his ardent follower, ask him to speak to them and give them of his truth.

### Of Love

3. Almitra asks the prophet about love; Almustafa speaks of the path of love which is worth following despite hardness and pain that sometimes accompany it; love strips away armor rendering one _naked_ and reshapes one into a more sacred being—if one, because of fear, seeks only _love's peace and love's pleasure_, then one should cover one's _nakedness_ and hence one will not fully experience the depths of love (_where you
shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
and weep, but not all of your tears._)
4. Love in its purest form gives only itself because there is no higher gift to give; love is freely given by the beloved expecting nothing in return—therefore, love does not seek to possess (_Love possesses not nor would it be possessed_)

### Of Marriage

5. Almitra asks about marriage; Almustafa conveys marriage's togetherness ever after but emphasizes keeping spaces (_But let there be spaces in your togetherness_); love is not bondage (_Fill each other's cup but drink not from
one cup_); even in togetherness, one must practise solitude and individualism (_Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music._)
6. Hearts are freely given but not possessed; togetherness is shared and one is not bound to the other—spaces in marriage give it strength and stability (_And stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow._)

### Of Children

7. _A woman who held a babe against her bosom_ asked about children; the prophet says parents do not possess their children (_Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they
belong not to you._)
8. Do not try to make them think and behave as a parent would, for they are their own persons (_You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts_.) They are the sons and daughters of Life and belong to tomorrow. Life always moves forward, toward the future. Parents are like bows; children, arrows and God, the archer (_For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable._)

### Of Giving

9. A rich man asks about giving; the prophet says: a person truly gives when they give of the self, not possessions. Giving with expectating return is a godly act (_There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward._) While it is good _to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding_. There is nothing one can _withhold_ (_All you have shall some day be given; Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'_)
10. While giving, one should not think if the other deserves it (_Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of all else
from you. And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream._) The receiver must share the giver's joy rather than feel the weight of indebtedness, for such weight puts the giver's generosity in doubt. (_For to be overmindful of your debt, is
to doubt his generosity who has the free­hearted earth for mother, and God for father._)

### Of Eating and Drinking

11. An old man asks about eating and drinking; the prophet says: it is necessary to eat and drink but they must be acts of worship, for they are violence against living things. All the living are governed by the same Nature's laws; a human too gives up life someday.
12. Through eating, life is transferred from a living vessel to another (_And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart, "Your seeds shall live in my body, And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,
And your fragrance shall be my breath,And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons."_)

### Of Work

13. A ploughman asked about work; the prophet says: work is a natural part of life, keeps the worker in rhythm with time and seasons. Approach work with love: (_And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. It is to build a house with affection, even as if your bebved were to dwell in that house. It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit. It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit, And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching._)
14. Without love, one must not work; for all work is noble when it is performed with love. Work without love results in a inferior end product (_For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but
half man's hunger._)

### Of Joy and Sorrow
