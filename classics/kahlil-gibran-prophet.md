### The Coming of the Ship

1. Almustafa, having lived in the city of Orphalese for 12 years, is filled with joy as the ship that will take him home arrives—but is soon stricken with sorrow (_Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets_); nevertheless realizes he has to go (_Yet I cannot tarry longer. The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark,_) and to leave everyone taking only memories (_And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun._)
2. The people of Orphalese gather around him and asks him to stay (_Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in
our midst become a memory_) but _he answered them not_; "seeress" Almitra, his ardent follower, ask him to speak to them and give them of his truth.

### Of Love

3. Almitra asks the prophet about love; Almustafa speaks of the path of love which is worth following despite hardness and pain that sometimes accompany it; love strips away armor rendering one _naked_ and reshapes one into a more sacred being—if one, because of fear, seeks only _love's peace and love's pleasure_, then one should cover one's _nakedness_ and hence one will not fully experience the depths of love (_where you
shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
and weep, but not all of your tears._)
4. Love in its purest form gives only itself because there is no higher gift to give; love is freely given by the beloved expecting nothing in return—therefore, love does not seek to possess (_Love possesses not nor would it be possessed_)

### Of Marriage

5. Almitra asks about marriage; Almustafa conveys marriage's togetherness ever after but emphasizes keeping spaces (_But let there be spaces in your togetherness_); love is not bondage (_Fill each other's cup but drink not from
one cup_); even in togetherness, one must practise solitude and individualism (_Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music._)
6. Hearts are freely given but not possessed; togetherness is shared and one is not bound to the other—spaces in marriage give it strength and stability (_And stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow._)

### Of Children

7. _A woman who held a babe against her bosom_ asked about children; the prophet says parents do not possess their children (_Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they
belong not to you._)
8. Do not try to make them think and behave as a parent would, for they are their own persons (_You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts_.) They are the sons and daughters of Life and belong to tomorrow. Life always moves forward, toward the future. Parents are like bows; children, arrows and God, the archer (_For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable._)

### Of Giving

9. A rich man asks about giving; the prophet says: a person truly gives when they give of the self, not possessions. Giving with expectating return is a godly act (_There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward._) While it is good _to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding_. There is nothing one can _withhold_ (_All you have shall some day be given; Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'_)
10. While giving, one should not think if the other deserves it (_Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of all else
from you. And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream._) The receiver must share the giver's joy rather than feel the weight of indebtedness, for such weight puts the giver's generosity in doubt. (_For to be overmindful of your debt, is
to doubt his generosity who has the free­hearted earth for mother, and God for father._)

### Of Eating and Drinking

11. An old man asks about eating and drinking; the prophet says: it is necessary to eat and drink but they must be acts of worship, for they are violence against living things. All the living are governed by the same Nature's laws; a human too gives up life someday.
12. Through eating, life is transferred from a living vessel to another (_And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart, "Your seeds shall live in my body, And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,
And your fragrance shall be my breath,And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons."_)

### Of Work

13. A ploughman asked about work; the prophet says: work is a natural part of life, keeps the worker in rhythm with time and seasons. Approach work with love: (_And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. It is to build a house with affection, even as if your bebved were to dwell in that house. It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit. It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit, And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching._)
14. Without love, one must not work; for all work is noble when it is performed with love. Work without love results in a inferior end product (_For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but
half man's hunger._)

### Of Joy and Sorrow

15. A woman asks about joy and sorrow; the prophet says: joy is only felt because one knows sorrow, and one only feels most joy when one has felt the depths of sorrow (_The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain._)
16. Joy and sorrow are inherently inseparable (_When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight._)

### Of Houses

17. A mason asks about houses; the prophet says: though the house is built within city walls, do not lose the spiritual connection with nature; in spirit, humans are wanderers; historically, people have gathered to build houses out of fear. But in doing so, they have separated themselves from nature and have lost both inner peace and a sense of beauty. 
18. Human spirit longs for nature, and should not be trapped in the house; (_But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed. Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast._) [Gibran lived simply, despite his success. From 1911 until he died, his main residence was a one-room apartment in New York.]

### Of Clothes

19. A weaver asks about clothes; the prophet says: clothes protect the body from the unclean but also conceals the natural body from the nature; he warns that clothes that give privacy may become a chain.
20. One must live simply, as close to nature as one can (_And forget not that the earth delightsto feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair._)

### Of Buying and Selling

21. A merchant asks about buying and selling; the prophet says: the earth provides food and things for all; no hunger or greed shall exist when they are exchanged with love.
22. Almustafa advises merchants to do no business with those who come to the market _barren-handed_, urging them to provide a means for the empty-handed to work for what they need (_And suffer not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour. To such men you should say, "Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your net; For the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us."_)

### Of Crime and Punishment

23. A judge asks about crime and punishment; the prophet says: the man who commits a crime is no different from any other, for all men walk the same path. A man stumbling on the path serves as a warning to those who follow and a rebuke to those ahead who dodged, but didn't remove the stumbling stone. 
24. The victim and the criminal share in the crime. Pure justice is not attainable, for the good and evil that reside in the hearts of criminals also reside in the hearts of those who judge. The harshest punishment for crime is remorse when it falls on the heart of the guilty.

### Of Laws

25. A lawyer asks about laws; the prophet says: people make laws and break them on a whim, like children building and breaking sand castles on a beach. Laws only serve the lawmakers, and people do not understand the serious consequences of careless lawmaking. 
26. Those who seek spiritual freedom from the laws, while hurting no one, find happiness. Having done others no harm, they need not fear the judgment of human laws.

### Of Freedom

27. An orator asks about freedom; the prophet says: worshipping freedom has made people slaves to freedom. The desire for freedom is so great that seeking it _becomes a harness to_ them. Freedom is not the absence of care, want and grief but rather accepting and rising above them.
28. To be free, people cannot abolish, erase, or cast off the things of this world. 

### Of Reason and Passion

29. The priestess aks about reason and passion; the prophet says: reason and judgment are often at war with passion and appetite, and the battlefield is the soul.
30. Reason and passion are necessary to each other. It's like sailing a ship: the rudder is reason, and its sails are passion. Let passion lift reason to great heights, and let reason be passion's guide.

### Of Pain

31. A woman asks about pain; the prophet says: pain results from exposure of truth that has been hidden or denied. Using the metaphor of the stone of the fruit breaking open, he says, when a truth breaks free, the cracking of the shell is painful, yet it exposes the truth to the _sunlight_ of awareness and understanding.
32. Understanding leads to spiritual growth. Healing is part of this process. The prophet compares this to the passing of seasons. Pain is like the _winter_.

### Of Self-Knowledge

33. When asked about self-knowledge, the prophet says: self-knowledge emerges in terms of silence, thoughts, and dreams. This is then transformed into sound, words and physical touch, which can then be perceived
34. Self-discovery is the personal path toward enlightenment that individual souls walk. These paths are as countless and varied as the seekers who travel them.

### Of Teaching

35. When asked about teaching, the prophet says: no teacher can give a student wisdom. A student acquires that on their own through awakened knowledge and contemplation. (_No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in thedawning of your knowledge. The teacher who walks in_)
36. Almustafa compares knowledge and wisdom by using the metaphor of wings. The _wings_ are understanding, and the _heights_ denote wisdom. A person, though they fly to great heights, cannot share their wings with another. The purpose of the teacher is thus to impart knowledge and confidence, so that students realize their own potential and put them on thier unique paths to wisdom.

### Of Friendship

37. When asked about friendship, the prophet says: a friend fulfills the need for shared love, joy, comfort, and peace. In friendship, we share ideas freely and in trust. In a friend's silence, we hear his heart's thoughts, desires, and expectations with our own heart.
38. Almustafa asks them not to grieve at the time of parting friends for, when we part with our friend, we see more clearly in his absence that which we love in him (_When you part from your friend, you grieve not; For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain._)

### Of Talking

39. When asked about talking, the prophet says: people talk when they are not at peace with their thoughts or seek to escape the solitude of the heart. Much of their talking prevents thinking (_And in much of your talking, thinking
is half murdered._) 
40. Some people seek _the talkative through fear of being alone._ Some who talk thoughtlessly reveal a truth unintentionally (_And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand._)

### Of Time

41. When asked about time, the prophet says: time is infinite and cannot be truly partitioned. Then he compares the infinite, indivisible nature of time to the qualities of love. In its power, love is boundless, though it is held within the heart. The flow of its movement cannot be broken into moments or deeds. 
42. Almustafa says that today does not stand in isolation from the past. The reality of each moment is built on and contains all that has gone before it. Today embraces the past and, in doing so, carries it forward as the future unfolds. 

### Of Good and Evil

43. When asked about good and evil, the prophet says: evil is good that has been corrupted by hunger and thirst. (_Of the good in you I can speak, but not
of the evil. For what is evil but good tortured byits own hunger and thirst?_) One is good when one gives of, or share, oneself. When one takes instead, one is not evil, but needy. 
44. The basic idea is this: One is good, and one is not evil when one is not good (_You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good_). One must not judge those who are slow to grow in goodness against those who grow swiftly (_For the truly good ask not the naked, "Where is your garment?" nor the houseless, "What has befallen your house?"_)

### Of Prayer

45. When asked about prayer, the prophet says: one prays in times of stress and need, but one should pray in times of joy and abundance as well. Prayers, then, are not only petitions for help but also a medium for giving thanks.
46. Almustafa speaks about the shared nature of prayer (_When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour, and whom save in prayer you may not meet._.)

### Of Pleasure

47. When asked about pleasure, the prophet says: pleasure is a _freedom-song_, that is, a by-product of spiritual freedom (_Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom. It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit._)
48. Pursuit of pleasure does not lead to pleasure alone, but to her seven _sisters_ (Gibran is probably referring to tantras of Indian religions) (_For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone; Seven are her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure._)

### Of Beauty

49. When asked about beauty, the prophet says: the search for beauty begins when a person experiences beauty and then wishes to define it. The search for beauty begins with an awakening to beauty's existence, and then beauty becomes the guide (_Where shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?_)
50. Almustafa clarifies what beauty is not, which is _needs unsatisfied_ (_Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied, And beauty is not need but an ecstasy._)

### Of Religion

51. When asked about religion, the prophet says: religion is all a person's deeds and all their reflections. Faith is reflected in a person's actions. Belief finds expression in a person's chosen pursuits. A person pours their love into all aspects of life, transforming the very nature of everyday activities.
52. Kahlil Gibran assumes people are essentially good, their deeds and thoughts guided by the god-self within. Thus, true religion comes from within and morality is a reflection of the person's inner religious life.

### Of Death

53. When asked about death, the prophet says: life and death are as inseparable as the river and the sea (_You would know the secret of death. But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?... For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one._)
54. The fear of death is unnecessary. Setting aside fear of death thus permits them to live fully, free from the shadow their fear casts over life (_Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing. And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance._). 

### The Farewell

55. As the prophet is about to leave, he speaks to them one last time saying he is a wanderer in spirit, if they should begin to forget his love for them or the truth of his counsel, he will return, like mist returns in rain.
56. After a while, the people disperse. Almitra stands alone on the sea wall, gazing after the ship and remembering Almustafa's last words: _"A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me."_
