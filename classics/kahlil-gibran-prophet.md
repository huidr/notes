### The Coming of the Ship

1. Almustafa, having lived in the city of Orphalese for 12 years, is filled with joy as the ship that will take him home arrives—but is soon stricken with sorrow (_Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets_); nevertheless realizes he has to go (_Yet I cannot tarry longer. The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark,_) and to leave everyone taking only memories (_And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun._)
2. The people of Orphalese gather around him and asks him to stay (_Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in
our midst become a memory_) but _he answered them not_; "seeress" Almitra, his ardent follower, ask him to speak to them and give them of his truth.

### Of Love

3. Almitra asks the prophet about love; Almustafa speaks of the path of love which is worth following despite hardness and pain that sometimes accompany it; love strips away armor rendering one _naked_ and reshapes one into a more sacred being—if one, because of fear, seeks only _love's peace and love's pleasure_, then one should cover one's _nakedness_ and hence one will not fully experience the depths of love (_where you
shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
and weep, but not all of your tears._)
4. Love in its purest form gives only itself because there is no higher gift to give; love is freely given by the beloved expecting nothing in return—therefore, love does not seek to possess (_Love possesses not nor would it be possessed_)

### Of Marriage

5. Almitra asks about marriage; Almustafa conveys marriage's togetherness ever after but emphasizes keeping spaces (_But let there be spaces in your togetherness_); love is not bondage (_Fill each other's cup but drink not from
one cup_); even in togetherness, one must practise solitude and individualism (_Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music._)
6. Hearts are freely given but not possessed; togetherness is shared and one is not bound to the other—spaces in marriage give it strength and stability (_And stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow._)

### Of Children

7. _A woman who held a babe against her bosom_ asked about children; the prophet says parents do not possess their children (_Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you yet they
belong not to you._)
8. Do not try to make them think and behave as a parent would, for they are their own persons (_You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts_.) They are the sons and daughters of Life and belong to tomorrow. Life always moves forward, toward the future. Parents are like bows; children, arrows and God, the archer (_For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable._)

### Of Giving

9. A rich man asks about giving;
