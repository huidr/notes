### Purgatorio

Dante and Virgil climb the Mount Purgatory in the southern hemisphere. "The poem posits the theory that all sins arise from love – either perverted love directed towards others' harm, or deficient love, or the disordered or excessive love of good things."

Dante describes Hell as existing underneath Jerusalem, having been created by the impact of Lucifer's fall; the Mountain of Purgatory was created by a displacement of rock caused by the same event.

**Ante-Purgatory: The Excommunicate** (Cantos I-III)

1. [I-II] Meets [Cato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Younger) (general guardian); an old stern man?—Angel Boatman carrying souls; Dante recognizes Casella (friend and musician), embraces him but grasps only air—Caella sings to comfort Dante; Cato urges the group to be on their way
2. [III] Not seeing Virgil's shadow, Dante panics fearing he has lost his guide; Virgil reassures him, explains spirits don't have bodies, hence no shadows—Tribe of souls (the excommunicate) detained at the base of the cliff for a period thirty times as long as their period of contumacy; poets ask for advice; awed by Dante's shadow; the excommunicate includes King Manfred of Sicily who says: prayer from those currently alive may reduce the amount of time a soul spends in purgatory

**Ante-Purgatory: The Late-Repentant** (Cantos IV-IX)

3. [IV] Virgil says, as one ascends, the climb feels easier, even though the mountain remains steep (Purgatory: place of purification, not mere punishment)—encounter souls resting in shade; these are sinners who repented at last minute; Dante recognizes friend Belacqua who explains: deathbed penitents must wait out the equivalent of another earthly life before beginning their ascent—[V] Pia de' Tolomei, who was murdered by her husband
4. [VI-VII] troubadour Sordello from Mantua (like Virgil), bows down to Virgil when he discovers his identity, explains to the poet, the rule of the mountain: after sunset souls are incapable of climbing any further (sun represents God)—[VIII] As sun sets, Dante, Virgil, and Sordello look down over the valley; see two angels whose job, Sordello explains, is to guard against a serpent (mini-Eden?)
5. [IX] Dante falls asleep; dreams of an eagle carrying him up near the scorching sun, suddenly wakes up at dawn; Virgil explains a lady named Lucia brought him up to Purgatory proper—portal (gate of Purgatory, Peter's gate) guarded by an angel bearing a naked sword—climb three steps: first, made of marble so polished reflective mirror-like (self-reflection, sees one's own sins); second, dark and cracked (sorrow, guilt); third, blood red (atonement)—tracing of letter P seven times on Dante's brow by the guard with the tip of his sword; each P shall be erased each time Dante ascends a terrace (sign of purgation?); guards opens Peter's gate

**Terrace I: Pride** (Cantos X-XII)

6. [X-XI] On the terrace where proud souls purge their sin, Dante and Virgil see beautiful sculptures expressing humility, the opposite virtue—among the sculptures are [Annunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation) to Virgin Mary, and Emperor [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) stopping his journey to render justice to a poor widow—Dante and Virgil meet the souls of the proud, who are bent over by the weight of huge stones on their backs; they profit from the sculpted examples of humility as they walk around the terrace
7. [XII] Dante notes sculptures under their feet, illustrating pride: Lucifer, the building of the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), Troy and others—reach the stairway to the second terrace at noon; Angel of Humility removes one P from Dante's brow; finds ascent easier

**Terrace II: Envy** (Cantos XIII-XV)

8. [XIII] The poets hear voices on the air telling stories of generosity, the opposite virtue: Virgin Mary expressing her joy for a newly married couple in [Wedding at Cana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_at_Cana), Jesus saying "Love thy enemies"; envious souls have their eyes sewn (_blindness_) with iron wire—the poets converse with [Sapia Salvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapia_Salvani)—[XIV] among the envious are Guido del Duca and Rinieri da Calboli, who tell about the deterioration of Florence and Tuscany—voices in the air include instances of envy: [Aglauros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglaurus,_daughter_of_Cecrops) (jealous of Hermes' love for her older sister) and [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel) (jealousy of his younger brother [Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel))—[XV] A bright sunlight shuts Dante's eyes, revealed to be the Angel of Charity who brushes away another P and invites him to the next terrace

**Terrace III: Wrath** (Cantos XV-XVII)

9. [XV] Dante sleepwalks, sees visions of meekness (opposite virtue): Mary in [Finding in the Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_in_the_Temple); wife of [Peisistratos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisistratus) wanting the execution of a man who kissed her daughter in public but Peisistratos swallowing his anger _“If we kill those who love us,” Pisistratus asks, “what shall we do with those who hate us?”_; Saint Stephen’s dying prayer for the forgiveness of his attackers.
10. [XVI] Engulfed by smoke, the poets meet Marco Lombardo, who tells them that the absence of virtue is due to individuals possessing free will and then he blames on political and religious leaders—[XVII] As daylight fades, Dante witnesses (in his mind) wrath manifested as familial violence ([Procne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procne)), genocidal rage ([Haman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman)), and spiteful harm to oneself ([Amata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amata)) and thus to loved ones. An angel leads the poets to the next stairway; as Dante climbs, he feels the angel's wings removing the thrid P from his face

**Terrace IV: Sloth** (Cantos XVII-XIX)

11. [XVIII] The poets see large, fast-moving crowd; two penitents shout out (weeping) examples of zeal (opposite virtue): Mary’s haste, following the annunciation, to visit pregnant Elizabeth and Caesar’s eagerness to drive his troops westward into Spain; one soul, continuing to run as he speaks, identifies himself as a twelfth-century abbot of the Church of Saint Zeno in Verona and laments the choice of his successor in Dante’s day—[XIX] Dante dreams about a defomed woman (turning into a Siren) who tries to seduce the poet and whose clothes were then ripped off by Virgil (on a saintly woman's command), thus revealing her belly, the imagined stench of which wakes the dreamer; Virgil explains to Dante that the significance of the dream was to show Dante the nature of temptation as well as the means of overcoming it;an angel removes the fourth P

**Terrace V: Avarice** (Cantos XIX-XXII)

12. [XIX] The penitents are "turned face downwards, lying on the earth" and lamenting loudly—[XX] One weeping soul contemplates famous people who preferred noble poverty to corrupt riches, or who generously shared their wealth with others: Mary giving birth in a cave, Saint Nicholas helping a family in distress by dropping gold coins into their window; the penitents meditate on the cautionary examples of greedy figures, such as King Midas—[XXI] The mountain trembles; the poets meet Statius (a poet and admirer of Virgil) who explains the trembling is due to a soul getting cleansed, praises _Aeneid_, says he would willingly serve extra time in Purgatory if he could have lived back when Virgil was alive to which Virgil urges Dante to keep silent. Statius, sensing the secret, demands to know, to which Dante reveals and Statius bows in admiration; Virgil urges Statius not to abase himself before a mere "shade"—[XXII] An angel wipes away Dante's fifth P

**Terrace VI: Gluttony** (Cantos XXII-XXIV)

13. [XXII] A voice from a strange tree recites examples of temperance (opposite virtue): Mary’s minimal regard for her own cravings at a wedding feast, Roman women satisfied with water, John the Baptist’s frugal existence in the wilderness—[XXIII]
