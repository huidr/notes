### Purgatorio

Dante and Virgil climb the Mount Purgatory in the southern hemisphere. "The poem posits the theory that all sins arise from love – either perverted love directed towards others' harm, or deficient love, or the disordered or excessive love of good things."

Dante describes Hell as existing underneath Jerusalem, having been created by the impact of Lucifer's fall; the Mountain of Purgatory was created by a displacement of rock caused by the same event.

**Ante-Purgatory: The Excommunicate** (Cantos I-III)

1. [I-II] Meets [Cato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Younger) (general guardian); an old stern man?—Angel Boatman carrying souls; Dante recognizes Casella (friend and musician), embraces him but grasps only air—Caella sings to comfort Dante; Cato urges the group to be on their way
2. [III] Not seeing Virgil's shadow, Dante panics fearing he has lost his guide; Virgil reassures him, explains spirits don't have bodies, hence no shadows—Tribe of souls (the excommunicate) detained at the base of the cliff for a period thirty times as long as their period of contumacy; poets ask for advice; awed by Dante's shadow; the excommunicate includes King Manfred of Sicily who says: prayer from those currently alive may reduce the amount of time a soul spends in purgatory

**Ante-Purgatory: The Late-Repentant** (Cantos IV-IX)

3. [IV] Virgil says, as one ascends, the climb feels easier, even though the mountain remains steep (Purgatory: place of purification, not mere punishment)—encounter souls resting in shade; these are sinners who repented at last minute; Dante recognizes friend Belacqua who explains: deathbed penitents must wait out the equivalent of another earthly life before beginning their ascent—[V] Pia de' Tolomei, who was murdered by her husband
4. [VI-VII] troubadour Sordello from Mantua (like Virgil), bows down to Virgil when he discovers his identity, explains to the poet, the rule of the mountain: after sunset souls are incapable of climbing any further (sun represents God)—[VIII] As sun sets, Dante, Virgil, and Sordello look down over the valley; see two angels whose job, Sordello explains, is to guard against a serpent (mini-Eden?)
5. [IX] Dante falls asleep; dreams of an eagle carrying him up near the scorching sun, suddenly wakes up at dawn; Virgil explains a lady named Lucia brought him up to Purgatory proper—portal (gate of Purgatory, Peter's gate) guarded by an angel bearing a naked sword—climb three steps: first, made of marble so polished reflective mirror-like (self-reflection, sees one's own sins); second, dark and cracked (sorrow, guilt); third, blood red (atonement)—tracing of letter P seven times on Dante's brow by the guard with the tip of his sword; each P shall be erased each time Dante ascends a terrace (sign of purgation?); guards opens Peter's gate

**Terrace I: Pride** (Cantos X-XII)

6. [X-XI] On the terrace where proud souls purge their sin, Dante and Virgil see beautiful sculptures expressing humility, the opposite virtue—among the sculptures are [Annunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation) to Virgin Mary, and Emperor [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan) stopping his journey to render justice to a poor widow—Dante and Virgil meet the souls of the proud, who are bent over by the weight of huge stones on their backs; they profit from the sculpted examples of humility as they walk around the terrace
7. [XII] Dante notes sculptures under their feet, illustrating pride: Lucifer, the building of the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), Troy and others—reach the stairway to the second terrace at noon; Angel of Humility removes one P from Dante's brow; finds ascent easier

**Terrace II: Envy** (Cantos XIII-XV)

8. [XIII] The poets hear voices on the air telling stories of generosity, the opposite virtue: Virgin Mary expressing her joy for a newly married couple in [Wedding at Cana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_at_Cana), Jesus saying "Love thy enemies"; envious souls have their eyes sewn (_blindness_) with iron wire—the poets converse with [Sapia Salvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapia_Salvani)—[XIV] among the envious are Guido del Duca and Rinieri da Calboli, who tell about the deterioration of Florence and Tuscany—voices in the air include instances of envy: [Aglauros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglaurus,_daughter_of_Cecrops) (jealous of Hermes' love for her older sister) and [Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel) (jealousy of his younger brother [Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel))—[XV] A bright sunlight shuts Dante's eyes, revealed to be the Angel of Charity who brushes away another P and invites him to the next terrace

**Terrace III: Wrath** (Cantos XV-XVII)

9. [XV] Dante sleepwalks, sees visions of meekness (opposite virtue): Mary in [Finding in the Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_in_the_Temple); wife of [Peisistratos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisistratus) wanting the execution of a man who kissed her daughter in public but Peisistratos swallowing his anger _“If we kill those who love us,” Pisistratus asks, “what shall we do with those who hate us?”_; Saint Stephen’s dying prayer for the forgiveness of his attackers.
10. [XVI] Engulfed by smoke, the poets meet Marco Lombardo, who tells them that the absence of virtue is due to individuals possessing free will and then he blames on political and religious leaders—[XVII] As daylight fades, Dante witnesses (in his mind) wrath manifested as familial violence ([Procne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procne)), genocidal rage ([Haman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman)), and spiteful harm to oneself ([Amata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amata)) and thus to loved ones. An angel leads the poets to the next stairway; as Dante climbs, he feels the angel's wings removing the third P from his face

**Terrace IV: Sloth** (Cantos XVII-XIX)

11. [XVIII] The poets see large, fast-moving crowd; two penitents shout out (weeping) examples of zeal (opposite virtue): Mary’s haste, following the annunciation, to visit pregnant Elizabeth and Caesar’s eagerness to drive his troops westward into Spain; one soul, continuing to run as he speaks, identifies himself as a twelfth-century abbot of the Church of Saint Zeno in Verona and laments the choice of his successor in Dante’s day—[XIX] Dante dreams about a defomed woman (turning into a Siren) who tries to seduce the poet and whose clothes were then ripped off by Virgil (on a saintly woman's command), thus revealing her belly, the imagined stench of which wakes the dreamer; Virgil explains to Dante that the significance of the dream was to show Dante the nature of temptation as well as the means of overcoming it; an angel removes the fourth P

**Terrace V: Avarice** (Cantos XIX-XXII)

12. [XIX] The penitents are "turned face downwards, lying on the earth" and lamenting loudly—[XX] One weeping soul contemplates famous people who preferred noble poverty to corrupt riches, or who generously shared their wealth with others: Mary giving birth in a cave, Saint Nicholas helping a family in distress by dropping gold coins into their window; the penitents meditate on the cautionary examples of greedy figures, such as King Midas—[XXI] The mountain trembles; the poets meet [Statius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statius) (a Latin poet and admirer of Virgil) who explains the trembling is due to a soul getting cleansed, praises _Aeneid_, says he would willingly serve extra time in Purgatory if he could have lived back when Virgil was alive to which Virgil urges Dante to keep silent. Statius, sensing the secret, demands to know, to which Dante reveals and Statius bows in admiration; Virgil urges Statius not to abase himself before a mere "shade"—[XXII] An angel wipes away Dante's fifth P

**Terrace VI: Gluttony** (Cantos XXII-XXIV)

13. [XXII] A voice from a strange tree recites examples of temperance (opposite virtue): Mary’s minimal regard for her own cravings at a wedding feast, Roman women satisfied with water, John the Baptist’s frugal existence in the wilderness—[XXIII] Statius accompanies Dante and Virgil; a group of penitent souls, shriveled up with hunger and thirst, gather round the poets; Dante is recognized by a friend from his youth, Forese Donati, who explains that the denial of nourishment causes the spirits’ “bodies” to waste away, who feels that his suffering now is just and laments about moral decline of Florence. Having died less than five years earlier, Forese attributes his speedy progress up the mountain to the prayers of his wife (Nella)
14. [XXIV] One penitent (poet Bonagiunta da Lucca) praises Dante; as Dante, Virgil, and Statius take their leave of the penitent souls, they are distracted by another oddly shaped tree with a fruit (this tree has some connection with the tree of Eden). A voice within the tree tells Dante not to be tempted to linger. He obeys and is soon greeted by an angel who wipes away the sixth scar on his forehead.

**Terrace VII: Lust** (Cantos XXV-XXVII)

15. [XXV] Virgil calls on Statius to satisfy Dante’s wish to know how shades on the previous terrace (gluttony) can waste away (get thinner) even though they no longer have earthly bodies. Statius replies with a detailed explanation of human physiology and the relation between mortal bodies and the form of the immortal soul in the afterlife. The travelers confront flames that extend out from the mountain wall, leaving only a narrow pathway on which to circle the terrace. Dante hears shades inside the fire singing a hymn (calling on God to help calm their lustful passions) and, between verses, shouting out examples of chastity (the Virgin Mary, the goddess Diana) and praising chaste spouses.
16. [XXVI] The penitents greet and are curious of the visitors, especially Dante who has a shadow; the lustful shades (souls) are divided into two: homosexuals and heterosexuals—[XXVII] An angel tells the travelers to cross a wall of flame; Dante was terrified (haunted by remembrance of human bodies burnt in real life) but Virgil assures him by reminding that the flame separates him from Beatrice; Dante is overwhelmed by heat but emerges unharmed, and falls asleep as he ascend on the steps. As night falls, Dante dreams of biblical sisters Leah (gathering flowers to make a garland) and Rachel (looking at herself in the mirror); the trio climb the final steps, reach the Earthly Paradise; Virgil tells Dante he has done his duty as a guide and he leaves him [Dante] to his own free will

**Earthly Paradise** (Cantos XXVIII-XXXIII)

17. [XXVIII] Dante, followed by Virgil and Statius, gazes at the dense forest in the day's first hours, his face caressed by soft morning breeze, sees a lovely woman ([Matelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matelda)) singing as she gathers flowers on the other bank of a river, who tells Dante he is in the [Garden of Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden), explains that the water separating her from Dante derives from a single source but flows in two directions, each stream having a name: Lethe (to forget sins) and Eunoe (to recall good acts)
18. [XXIX] Dantes witnesses a procession led by 7 tall candles painting the sky with colors of ranbow, followed by 24 elders (in white). Then 4 winged creatures escort a chariot drawn by a [Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin). The procession abruptly stops with a sound of thunder—[XXX] Beatrice appears in the chariot; Dante's excitement turns to sorrow as he realiszes Virgil has left; she rebukes him for straying from the path of righteousness after her death, tells him that he can enter paradise but only after hating his sins
19. [XXXI] Dante (sobbing) confesses his sins: attachment to worldly things and false pleasures; Beatrice tells him that her death should have prompted him to put aside worldly things altogether; looking at her eyes, Dante is overcome with emotion and faints; Dante wakes to find himself neck deep in the river Lethe with Matelda plunging him under the surface so that he swallows water
20. [XXXII] The procession resumes and Dante follows it to arrive at the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil) (now bare of its leaves) where he falls asleep; Dante wakes up to see an eagle crashing through the tree into the chariot followed by a series of violent assaults (allegory of events in church history)—[XXXIII] Beatrice prophesies that God will avenge the offence by sending someone; at noon, Matelda leads Dante, accompanied by Statius, into the river Eunoe; cleansed and remade, Dante is ready to ascend to Paradise.

### Paradiso

**Moon**: Vow Breakers (Cantos I-V)

1. It's noon, and Dante stands with Beatrice in the Garden of Eden. As they ascend through the atmosphere, Dante has a strange out-of-body experience. Beatrice explains: human souls has innate tendency toward God, and since he has been purified of his sins, he feels this attraction.
2. Dante gives a warning to his readers whom, he expects, are scholars, theologians and philosophers. The Moon is a solid, dense cloud. He asks Beatrice why the Moon has dark spots. He recounts several stories he has heard, however Beatrice explains: the uneveness is the reflection of the variety God has put in His creation.
3. Piccarda, sister of Dante's childhood friend Donati, explains: souls in the Moon are virtuous souls but who failed to fulfill some vows. Piccardo vowed to be a nun but was taken from her convent by force. Dante enquires if the spirits are dissatisfied with the lower Heaven; they say they are content and otherwise, it wouldn't be paradise for they would be opposing God's will.
4. Dante wonders if Plato was right when he said that souls go back to stars upon death. Beatrice answers that it is partly true—souls of Piccarda and others are not remote from God, and stars-and-planets imagery is simply a way of telling God's presence for the limited mortal mind.
5. Beatrice explains: free will is God's greatest gift to mankind. One should not make vows in haste. Then the duo travels to Mercury and a flock of spirits greet them.

**Mercury**: Fame Seekers (Cantos V-VII)

6. The 6th-century Byzantine emperor Justinian speaks to Dante about his past life, recounts the history of Rome from its mythological origins and is disdainful of the constant violence over the rule of Rome. (This is the only canto in _Divine Comedy_ written entirely in one voice—that of Justinian).
7. Beatrice narrates God's journey to Earth in the form of a human to set things right and then to sacrifice his life. While this may sound unnecessary (because God could have just forgiven humanity), Beatrice says, it is the right and finest way—to live as a human, suffer and pay the debt.

**Venus**: Ardent Lovers (Cantos VIII-IX)

8. Dante asks Charles Martel (was briefly a king of Hungary) "How can it be that sweet seed leads to sour?" (how can the children of a wise and just ruler not follow his footsteps?) God gives humans unique skills to play different roles in society, Charles says, but they often use it wrongly and force themselves into roles they are ill-suited.
9. The souls explain that the inhabitants of Venus are those who gave in to earthly pleasures—particularly sexual desires. But they are not saddened by their past nor do they repent—there are no unhappy souls in paradise.

**Sun**: Wise Spirits (Cantos X-XIV)

10. The souls gather around Dante and Beatrice in a halo and sing a song. Then they encounter Thomas Aquinas, who identifies several philosophers, theologians and historians.
