### Inferno

### Purgatorio

Dante and Virgil climb the Mount Purgatory in the southern hemisphere. "The poem posits the theory that all sins arise from love – either perverted love directed towards others' harm, or deficient love, or the disordered or excessive love of good things."

Dante describes Hell as existing underneath Jerusalem, having been created by the impact of Lucifer's fall; the Mountain of Purgatory was created by a displacement of rock caused by the same event.

**Ante-Purgatory: The Excommunicate** (Cantos I-III)

1. [I-II] Meets Cato (general guardian); an old stern man?—Angel Boatman carrying souls; Dante recognizes Casella (friend and musician), embraces him but grasps only air—Caella sings to comfort Dante; Cato urges the group to be on their way
2. [III] Not seeing Virgil's shadow, Dante panics fearing he has lost his guide; Virgil reassures him, explains spirits don't have bodies, hence no shadows—Tribe of souls (the excommunicate) detained at the base of the cliff for a period thirty times as long as their period of contumacy; poets ask for advice; awed by Dante's shadow; the excommunicate includes King Manfred of Sicily who says: prayer from those currently alive may reduce the amount of time a soul spends in purgatory

**Ante-Purgatory: The Late-Repentant** (Cantos IV-IX)

3. [IV] Virgil says, as one ascends, the climb feels easier, even though the mountain remains steep (Purgatory: place of purification, not mere punishment)—encounter souls resting in shade; these are sinners who repented at last minute; Dante recognizes friend Belacqua who explains: deathbed penitents must wait out the equivalent of another earthly life before beginning their ascent
4. [V] Pia de' Tolomei, who was murdered by her husband—[VI-VII] troubadour Sordello from Mantua (like Virgil), bows down to Virgil when he discovers his identity, explains to the poet, the rule of the mountain: after sunset souls are incapable of climbing any further (sun represents God)
5. [VIII] As sun sets, Dante, Virgil, and Sordello look down over the valley; see two angels whose job, Sordello explains, is to guard against a serpent (mini-Eden?)
6. [IX] Dante falls asleep; dreams of an eagle carrying him up near the scorching sun, suddenly wakes up at dawn; Virgil explains a lady named Lucia brought him up to Purgatory proper—portal (gate of Purgatory, Peter's gate) guarded by an angel bearing a naked sword—climb three steps: first, made of marble so polished reflective mirror-like (self-reflection, sees one's own sins); second, dark and cracked (sorrow, guilt); third, blood red (atonement)—tracing of letter P seven times on Dante's brow by the guard with the tip of his sword; each P shall be erased each time Dante ascends a terrace (sign of purgation?); guards opens Peter's gate

**Terrace I: Pride** (Cantos X-
