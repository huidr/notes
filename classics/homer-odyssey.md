### The story of Ulysses

9. [Book IX](#book-ix)—

### Book I

_The gods in council—Minerva's visit to Ithica—The challenge from Telemachus to the suitors._

Ulysses has been stranded alone on an island for years, held captive by a nymph Calypso, who is in love with him. He is also hiding from Neptune who is angry with him for having blinded his son Polyphemus.

On Mt. Olympus, gods agree Ulysses would reach home. Minerva descends, disguising as Mentes (Ulysses's old friend), and counsels Telemachus to protect Penelope and the land from the suitors. Later, Telemachus asks the suitors to leave.

### Book II

_Assembly of the people of Ithica—Speeches of Telemachus and of the suitors—Telemachus makes his preparations and starts for Pylos with Minerva disguised as mentor._

The suitors have been feeding on the wealth of Penelope. With new courage and confidence offered by Minerva, Telemachus gathers an assembly and asks the suitors to leave. Antinous blames it on Penelope who promised to marry one of the suitors when she has finished her weaving a shroud but has been undoing each day's weaving to postpone the wedding indefinitely.

Telemachus wishes for a ship. Minerva, now disguising herself as Telemachus, gathers a ship and crew. The old nurse Eurycleia implores Telemachus not to venture into the sea like his father did and died, but he assures her that a god is with him and asks her not to tell his mother about his journey unless inquired because he doesn't want her mother to lose her beauty by shedding tears.

### Book III

_Telemachus visits Nestor at Pylos._

Telemachus and Minerva, disguised as mentor, reaches the land of Nestor where they witness a large ceremonial sacrifices to Neptune. Nestor has little information about Ulysses, but narrates how the Achaeans went different ways after the war. Agamemnon had left his cousin Aegisthus to rule in his stead during the Trojan War, but Aegisthus seized the throne and became the lover of Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra. Upon his return, Agamemnon was killed by the usurper; the king's death was then avenged by his son Orestes, and daughter Electra.

Nestor offers lodging for the night and a chariot and the help of his son Pisistratus for his journey to Sparta to meet Menelaus. Minerva flies away as an eagle, and Nestor makes sacrifice to honor her.

### Book IV

_The visit to King Minelaus, who tells his story—Meanwhile the suitors in Ithica plot against Telemachus._

The travelers reach Sparta. There is a feast for the wedding of Menelaus's daughter to Achilles's son. Menelaus and Helen recount some anecdotes of Ulysses's bravery and wit such as once, disguising as a beggar, infiltrated Troy alone. Menelaus is shocked to hear about Telemachus's present life. He recounts his return home, how he got stranded on the island of Pharos owing to insufficient sacrifice to gods, how he and his men wrestled with the shape-shifting god Proteus and forced him to tell him how to leave the island and about his friends. Ajax would have lived if not for his boast; Neptune killed him when he boasted not even gods could kill him. Upon reaching, Agamemnon kissed his native land and was invited to a feast by his cousin who later killed him. Ulysses was stranded on an island with no ship or crew.

Back in Ithica, the suitors plan to assassinate Telemachus upon his return. Penelope is in distress, but Minerva lets her know that she is with her son and will protect him.

### Book V

_Calypso—Ulysses reaches Scheria on a raft._

Jove decides Odysseus leave the island and reach Scheria but his journey will be perilous. Mercury visits Calypso who is furious to learn of Jove's will. She taunts the double standard of male gods, who philander with mortal women but deny the same freedom to goddesses. She grudgingly agrees to let him go. Later she finds him weeping. He is in disbelief that Calypso would free him. Calypso tells him that the road ahead would be hard and if he knew what lay ahead, he would stay. Nevertheless he chooses to leave and Calypso asks him to build a raft and supplies tools and clothes for his journey.

Ulysses sails the raft but Neptune torments him on the sea. When his ship breaks, he swims. Minerva and a sea nymph to his rescue. Finally he reaches the shore.

### Book VI

_The meeting between Nausicaa and Ulysses._

Scheria is inhabited by Phaeacians. Minerva lures Nausicaa (king Alcinous's daughter) and her maids to come near the shore where Ulysses has been sleeping. Ulysses is woken up by the sounds of the women but they, except Nausicaa, scatter when they see a man tired, shaggy and naked save for some leaves. Ulysses pleads with her for help. She gives him clothes and he washes himself in a river. She gives directions to her house but he must enter alone and ask queen Arete for help.

### Book VII

_Reception of Ulysses at the palace of King Alcinous._

Disguising as a small girl, Minerva takes Ulysses to Arete's place. She cloaks him in a dark mist to avoid being seen and asks him to not talk to the people. Upon meeting Alcinous and Arete, he pleads for help. Arete is suspicious for he is wearing clothes she recognises. When asked, he narrates his story. Impressed by Ulysses's sense of respect and honor toward his daughter, Alcinous wishes Ulysses to marry her but agrees to provide a ship for his home return.

### Book VIII

_Banquet in the house of Alcinous—The games._

Alcinous gathers the Phaeacians; Minerva helps rouse interest. Alcinous declares a feast would be held when they have found a ship and crew for the wanderer. During the celebration, the bard Demodocus sings the legend of a verbal battle between Agamemnon and Ulysses during the Trojan war and their return journey, moving Ulysses to tears, which although he tries to hide it, Alcinous notices and proposes an athletic competition to distract the crowd.

One champion of the competition invites Ulysses to take part which he declines citing his weariness. On being teased, he joins the competition and wins it. Later, Ulysses asks Demodocus to sing about the wooden horse. When the bard sings about the Achaeans and Ulysses's bravery in defeating Troy, he weeps again. Alcinous asks him to reveal himself.

### Book IX

_Ulysses declares himself and begins his story—The Cicons, Lotophagi, and Cyclopes._
