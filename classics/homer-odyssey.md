### Ulysses

5. [Book V]()

### Book I

Ulysses has been stranded alone on an island for years, held captive by a nymph Calypso, who is in love with him. He is also hiding from Neptune who is angry with him for having blinded his son Polyphemus.

On Mt. Olympus, gods agree Ulysses would reach home. Minerva descends, disguising as Mentes (Ulysses's old friend), and counsels Telemachus to protect Penelope and the land from the suitors. Later, Telemachus asks the suitors to leave.

### Book II

The suitors have been feeding on the wealth of Penelope. With new courage and confidence offered by Minerva, Telemachus gathers an assembly and asks the suitors to leave. Antinous blames it on Penelope who promised to marry one of the suitors when she has finished her weaving a shroud but has been undoing each day's weaving to postpone the wedding indefinitely.

Telemachus wishes for a ship. Minerva, now disguising herself as Telemachus, gathers a ship and crew. The old nurse Eurycleia implores Telemachus not to venture into the sea like his father did and died, but he assures her that a god is with him and asks her not to tell his mother about his journey unless inquired because he doesn't want her mother to lose her beauty by shedding tears.

### Book III

Telemachus and Minerva, disguised as Mentor, reaches the land of Nestor where they witness a large ceremonial sacrifices to Neptune. Nestor has little information about Ulysses, but narrates how the Achaeans went different ways after the war. Agamemnon had left his cousin Aegisthus to rule in his stead during the Trojan War, but Aegisthus seized the throne and became the lover of Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra. Upon his return, Agamemnon was killed by the usurper; the king's death was then avenged by his son Orestes, and daughter Electra.

Nestor offers lodging for the night and a chariot and the help of his son Pisistratus for his journey to Sparta to meet Menelaus. Minerva flies away as an eagle, and Nestor makes sacrifice to honor her.

### Book IV

The travelers reach Sparta. There is a feast for the wedding of Menelaus's daughter to Achilles's son. Menelaus and Helen recount some anecdotes of Ulysses's bravery and wit such as once, disguising as a beggar, infiltrated Troy alone. Menelaus is shocked to hear about Telemachus's present life. He recounts his return home, how he got stranded on the island of Pharos owing to insufficient sacrifice to gods, how he and his men wrestled with the shape-shifting god Proteus and forced him to tell him how to leave the island and about his friends. Ajax would have lived if not for his boast; Neptune killed him when he boasted not even gods could kill him. Upon reaching, Agamemnon kissed his native land and was invited to a feast by his cousin who later killed him. Ulysses was stranded on an island with no ship or crew.

Back in Ithica, the suitors plan to assassinate Telemachus upon his return. Penelope is in distress, but Minerva lets her know that she is with her son and will protect him.
