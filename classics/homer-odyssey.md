### Book I

_The gods in council—Minerva's visit to Ithaca—The challenge from Telemachus to the suitors._

Ulysses has been stranded alone on an island for years, held captive by a nymph Calypso, who is in love with him. He is also hiding from Neptune who is angry with him for having blinded his son Polyphemus.

On Mt. Olympus, gods agree Ulysses would reach home. Minerva descends, disguising as Mentes (Ulysses's old friend), and counsels Telemachus to protect Penelope and the land from the suitors. Later, Telemachus asks the suitors to leave.

### Book II

_Assembly of the people of Ithaca—Speeches of Telemachus and of the suitors—Telemachus makes his preparations and starts for Pylos with Minerva disguised as mentor._

The suitors have been feeding on the wealth of Penelope. With new courage and confidence offered by Minerva, Telemachus gathers an assembly and asks the suitors to leave. Antinous blames it on Penelope who promised to marry one of the suitors when she has finished her weaving a shroud but has been undoing each day's weaving to postpone the wedding indefinitely.

Telemachus wishes for a ship. Minerva, now disguising herself as Telemachus, gathers a ship and crew. The old nurse Eurycleia implores Telemachus not to venture into the sea like his father did and died, but he assures her that a god is with him and asks her not to tell his mother about his journey unless inquired because he doesn't want her mother to lose her beauty by shedding tears.

### Book III

_Telemachus visits Nestor at Pylos._

Telemachus and Minerva, disguised as Mentor, reaches the land of Nestor where they witness a large ceremonial sacrifices to Neptune. Nestor has little information about Ulysses, but narrates how the Achaeans went different ways after the war. Agamemnon had left his cousin Aegisthus to rule in his stead during the Trojan War, but Aegisthus seized the throne and became the lover of Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra. Upon his return, Agamemnon was killed by the usurper; the king's death was then avenged by his son Orestes, and daughter Electra.

Nestor offers lodging for the night and a chariot and the help of his son Pisistratus for his journey to Sparta to meet Menelaus. Minerva flies away as an eagle, and Nestor makes sacrifice to honor her.

### Book IV

_The visit to King Minelaus, who tells his story—Meanwhile the suitors in Ithaca plot against Telemachus._

The travelers reach Sparta. There is a feast for the wedding of Menelaus's daughter to Achilles's son. Menelaus and Helen recount some anecdotes of Ulysses's bravery and wit such as once, disguising as a beggar, infiltrated Troy alone. Menelaus is shocked to hear about Telemachus's present life. He recounts his return home, how he got stranded on the island of Pharos owing to insufficient sacrifice to gods, how he and his men wrestled with the shape-shifting god Proteus and forced him to tell him how to leave the island and about his friends. Ajax would have lived if not for his boast; Neptune killed him when he boasted not even gods could kill him. Upon reaching, Agamemnon kissed his native land and was invited to a feast by his cousin who later killed him. Ulysses was stranded on an island with no ship or crew.

Back in Ithaca, the suitors plan to assassinate Telemachus upon his return. Penelope is in distress, but Minerva lets her know that she is with her son and will protect him.

### Book V

_Calypso—Ulysses reaches Scheria on a raft._

Jove decides Odysseus leave the island and reach Scheria but his journey will be perilous. Mercury visits Calypso who is furious to learn of Jove's will. She taunts the double standard of male gods, who philander with mortal women but deny the same freedom to goddesses. She grudgingly agrees to let him go. Later she finds him weeping. He is in disbelief that Calypso would free him. Calypso tells him that the road ahead would be hard and if he knew what lay ahead, he would stay. Nevertheless he chooses to leave and Calypso asks him to build a raft and supplies tools and clothes for his journey.

Ulysses sails the raft but Neptune torments him on the sea. When his ship breaks, he swims. Minerva and a sea nymph to his rescue. Finally he reaches the shore.

### Book VI

_The meeting between Nausicaa and Ulysses._

Scheria is inhabited by Phaeacians. Minerva lures Nausicaa (king Alcinous's daughter) and her maids to come near the shore where Ulysses has been sleeping. Ulysses is woken up by the sounds of the women but they, except Nausicaa, scatter when they see a man tired, shaggy and naked save for some leaves. Ulysses pleads with her for help. She gives him clothes and he washes himself in a river. She gives directions to her house but he must enter alone and ask queen Arete for help.

### Book VII

_Reception of Ulysses at the palace of King Alcinous._

Disguising as a small girl, Minerva takes Ulysses to Arete's place. She cloaks him in a dark mist to avoid being seen and asks him to not talk to the people. Upon meeting Alcinous and Arete, he pleads for help. Arete is suspicious for he is wearing clothes she recognises. When asked, he narrates his story. Impressed by Ulysses's sense of respect and honor toward his daughter, Alcinous wishes Ulysses to marry her but agrees to provide a ship for his home return.

### Book VIII

_Banquet in the house of Alcinous—The games._

Alcinous gathers the Phaeacians; Minerva helps rouse interest. Alcinous declares a feast would be held when they have found a ship and crew for the wanderer. During the celebration, the bard Demodocus sings the legend of a verbal battle between Agamemnon and Ulysses during the Trojan war and their return journey, moving Ulysses to tears, which although he tries to hide it, Alcinous notices and proposes an athletic competition to distract the crowd.

One champion of the competition invites Ulysses to take part which he declines citing his weariness. On being teased, he joins the competition and wins it. Later, Ulysses asks Demodocus to sing about the wooden horse. When the bard sings about the Achaeans and Ulysses's bravery in defeating Troy, he weeps again. Alcinous asks him to reveal himself.

### Book IX

_Ulysses declares himself and begins his story—The Cicons, Lotophagi, and Cyclopes._

Ulysses reveals his identity and recounts his journey following the Trojan war. They sacked an island inhabited by the Cicons. Ulysses reminds his men they need to leave quickly but is ignored. The Cicons from the mainland retaliate and after a loss of many lives, they sail away but are blown off course by storms. They reach the land of lotus-eaters. Upon eating lotus, they begin to forget memories of home. Finally, Ulysses is able to convince his men to leave the place. Thus they sail off and reach the land of Cyclopes—one-eyed giants, lawless, savage and uncivilized.

One such Cyclope, Polyphemus, denies hospitality, captures and kills many of the travelers. Ulysses tells him that his name is "Noman", then offers him a drink. The drink puts him to sleep and Ulysses blinds his eye. Polyphemus screams and the other Cyclopes rush to his cave and asks him who hurt him. Polyphemus answers, "No man" and they leave. Later, Ulysses reveals his true identity, which does not surprise the giant because this episode has been prophesied. Polyphemus calls upon his father Neptune to avenge him by ensuring that Ulysses never gets home or if he does, all his men should perish and his home be troubled.

### Book X

_Aeolus, the Laestrygones, Circe._

The travelers land and stay in the home of Aeolus for a month. Aeolus, the master of winds, offers Ulysses gifts and a pouch that contains all the winds that would have otherwise blow them off course. After ten days of sailing, they see their native land in the horizon. Pleased, Ulysses falls asleep, but his men accidentally open the pouch and the winds bring them back to the home of Aeolus. Suprised, Aeolus asks them why they have come back but upon learning the truth, he is furious and ask them to be away. Then they reach the land of Laestrygonians, giant cannibals, who devour many of the travelers. After much effort, Ulysses succeeds in rowing away with the remaining men. Finally they reach the island of Aeaea where the cunning goddess Circe dwells.

Ulysses gives a half of his men under the command of Eurylochus who sets out in the forest. They hear the sweet voice of a woman/goddess who is working at her loom. She invites them in. All go in, except the suspicious Eurylochus, but none come out. Horrified, Eurylochus flees back to Ulysses and recounts the story. Ulysses goes into the forest, find Mercury in disguise of a young man who gives a herb that is immune to Circe's potion. Then Circe invites Ulysses to her house, gives him her potion and uses her wand to turn him into a pig. Circe deduces he is Ulysses whom Mercury prophesied would come. Ulysses forces Circle to swear she would do mischief no more to him and his men. Circle agrees, and they sleep together. Later, Circe turns his men back to human form. They live there for a year. She then tells Ulysses that before sailing home, he must first sail for the land of Hades and speak to the prophet Tiresias. He need not worry, for the North wind will take his ship there.

### Book XI

_The visit to the dead._

On the land of Hades, Ulysses  encounters ghosts of the dead. Elpenor demands a proper funeral, which Ulysses promises. Ulysses sees his mother whom he did not know had died. She died in grief over her son's absence. Tiresias tells him he could reach Ithaca but ahead lies great peril and informs him what is happening in his home. Ulysses encounters several wives and daughters, some of them boasts of having slept with gods including Jove and Neptune.

Ulysses sees his fallen comrades. Agamemnon weeps and recollects how Clytemnestra murdered him, his comrades and Cassandra. He urges Ulysses to be careful of women although he declares Penelope is virtuous. Achilles inquires about his father and son. Ulysses knows nothing of his father but tells him the exploits of his son during the Trojan war and that he safely sailed away. Great Ajax is still angry with Ulysses over Achilles's armor.

### Book XII

_The Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, the cattle of the sun._

Back on Aeaea, the travelers give Elpenor a proper funeral. Circe warns Ulysses of the upcoming perils. First, they should not listen to the Sirens who lure sailors to shipwrecks. Second, there are two potential routes to Ithaca, one through the Wandering Rocks whence no ship, except Argo with Juno's help, ever survived, the other through six-headed immortal monster Scylla and whirlpool monster Charybdis. Third, when they land on the island of Helios, they must not harm the cattle; otherwise, his ship and entire crew (except possibly himself) shall perish.

The travelers put wax into their ears, thus are immune to the sweet voices of the Sirens; however, Ulysses, being curious, listens but his body is bound tightly to the ship, so he doesn't break free. Then Ulysses chooses the route through Scylla and Charybdis where Scylla devours six of his men. Ulysses then warns their greatest danger lies in the island of Helios and suggests they go on with their journey. Eurylochus rebukes him for being cruel and denying his tired crew a supper. Everyone applauds and Ulysses yields but warns them never to touch any cattle but be content with the food given by Circe. The crew take an oath but when the food reserves are exhausted and while Ulysses is away, Eurylochus convinces them to feed on the cattle. Jove tells Helios he will strike them with thunderbolt. The ship wrecks and the crew perish. Finally Ulysses lands on the Ogygian island where Calypso dwells.

### Book XIII

_Ulysses leaves Scheria and returns to Ithaca._

On route to Ithaca, Ulysses falls asleep. The Phaeacians put him and his treasure safely on the shore and left. Neptune is furious at the Phaeacians for helping Ulysses. He wrecks the ship. Dismayed, Alcinous remembers a prophecy and to save their city from being buried under a mountain, they offer sacrifices to Neptune. Ulysses wakes up to find himself in an unknown land. He sees Minerva, disguised as a shepherd, and he pretends to be someone else. Then Minerva reveals her identity. She hides the treasure in a cave and changes his physique so that no one will recognise him. Then they plan how he should face his foes at his home.

### Book XIV

_Ulysses in the hut with Eumaeus._

In disguise of an old beggar, Ulysses meets his old swineherd Eumaeus, who believes his master Ulysses is dead. When pressed, the traveler makes up his story and tells him Ulysses is alive and shall come, which Eumaeus refuses to believe. Nevertheless, Eumaeus gives him food and shelter.

### Book XV

_Minerva summons Telemachus from Lacedaemon—He meets with Theoclymenus at Pylos and brings him to Ithaca—On landing he goes to the hut of Eumaeus._

Before dawn, Minerva wakes Telemachus, tells him about the assassination plot and asks him to leave immediately. She also offers him a strategy to avoid their ambush. With gifts from Menelaus and Helen, Telemachus leaves with Pisistratus. Theoclymenus, a seer and exile, seeks refuge in his ship. (He escaped from Argos after killing a relative, fled to Pylos).

Back in Eumaeus's hut, the traveler tells Eumaeus that he plans to go begging and ask the suitors to be their servant. Shocked at this idea, Eumaeus tells him the suitors only take young servants and asks the traveler to rather stay with him. The swineherd tells him Laertes is still alive. When asked, he narrates his story. Eumaeus was born into royalty but was kidnapped and forced to become a servant.

On the way back, Theoclymenus interprets an action of a hawk as a omen that Telemachus shall reign in Ithaca as the most powerful royalty. Telemachus hopes it comes true and promises gifts for him if it does. Then he asks his friend Piraeus to give Theoclymenus shelter. Then off he goes to Eumaeus.

### Book XVI

_Ulysses reveals himself to Telemachus._

Telemachus inquires Eumaeus about the old traveler. Eumaeus asks him if he could take him home, which Telemachus declines as he is alone and cannot even face the suitors. The traveler declares if he [traveler] were Ulysses or Ulysses's son, he would have rather fought and died in his house than let his estate degraded by foes. Telemachus sends Eumaeus to tell Penelope that her son has returned. Upon Minerva's advice, the traveler returns to the hut after having changed to a younger version of himself. Telemachus wonders if he is a god. The traveler reveals his identity and they plan how to thwart the suitors.

Back at the palace, the suitors plot how to kill Telemachus. Amphinomus is the most well-behaved of the suitors. He is against killing Telemachus. He suggests they should be patient and wait for the will of gods.

### Book XVII

_Telemachus and his mother meet—Ulysses and Eumaeus come down to the town, and Ulysses is insulted by Melanthius—He is recognized by the dog Argos—He is insulted and presently struck by Antinous with a stool—Penelope desires that he shall be sent to her._

In the palace, Piraeus brings Theoclymenus and Telemachus narrates his journey to his mother. Theoclymenus predicts Ulysses is back in Itaca, reading to throw out the suitors; Penelope refuses to believe. On the road, Melanthius mocks the swineherd and the beggar. On Telemachus's advice, the beggar goes around the suitors begging. Most have pity but Antinous mocks him and the swineherd for bringing him in. The beggar prays Antinous would be punished by the gods. Antinous grows furious and hits the beggar with a footstool. Penelope is displeased with the suitors; she asks Eumaeus to invite the beggar in, as she wants to hear his stories and particularly about Ulysses. The beggar acts quite reasonably; he wants to meet her at sundown when the suitors are away.

### Book XVIII

_The fight with Irus—Ulysses warns Amphinomus—Penelope gets presents from the suitors—The braziers—Ulysses rebukes Eurymachus._

Another beggar Irus mocks the old beggar. Antinous convinces Irus to fight the old beggar. Irus is defeated rather easily. The beggar warns Amphinomus of dire events to come and suggests he leave; Amphinomus is alarmed but stays. Then, in the presence of the suitors, the beggar asks the servants to tend to Penelope, but is laughed at. One such woman mocks him for his behavior, but he threatens them. The suitors protests, but Amphinomus calms them down and let Telemachus tend to the beggar.

Telemachus and the beggar hide the weapons in the house. Melantho rails at the beggar again, but Penelope rebukes her. The beggar and Penelope have a conversation; the beggar makes up his story; he is the brother of Idomeneus, a descendant of Minos of Creta. Penelope is convinced that he met Ulysses when he describes what exactly Ulysses wore, and she sobs but refuses to believe that Ulysses will be there soon that year. While washing his legs, Eurycleia notices a scar and deduces he is Ulysses, but is made to hold her tongue. Eurycleia offers to tell him which maids are disloyal to him; Ulysses tells he will judge for himself. Penelope recounts her dream (an eagle killing all the geese) to Ulysses. Penelope tells him that she plans to hold a competition the next day to finally choose a suitor. She will ask them to demonstrate a skill that Ulysses has demonstrated before. The beggar tells her Ulysses will come before the competition can begin. She retires to her room and weeps.

Ulysses cannot fall asleep, thinking how he would face the suitors the next day. Minerva visits him. Ulysses overhears Penelope praying for her death if Ulysses doesn't appear. Melanthius mocks the beggar for still staying, but Philoetius is kind to him. The suitors plan to murder Telemachus, but Amphinomus declares they will not succeed, rather they should go to dinner. The seer Theoclymenus warns the suitors of the bad omens he sees. The suitors laugh him off. One insolent fellow mocks Telemachus for bringing the swineherd and then the seer.

### Book XXI

_The trial of the axes, during which Ulysses reveals himself to Eumaeus and Philoetius._

The contest commences. Penelope brings out Ulysses's bow. Telemachus tries and fails to string it three times; on the fourth, his father signals him to stop. The beggar reveals his identity to Eumaeus and Philoetius after they swear they would fight for Ulysses if he returns. They weep. The suitors take turns and each one of them fails. Antinous requests to postpone the contest for a day. After all the suitors fail, the beggar requests to try to string the bow. Antinous is furious and rebukes him. Penelope questions him if he is scared that the beggar may succeed and marry her; to this, Eurymachus replies they fear a scandal if no suitor can string it while an old beggar does. As planned, Eumaeus tries to bring the bow to the beggar but drops it when the suitors scold him. Telemachus encourages him to take it up again and give it to the beggar. The suitors laughs at Telemachus. The beggar then asks Eurycleia to close the doors of the women's apartments. To the dismay of the suitors, he easily strings it and shoots an arrow through the 12 axes. Telemachus arms himself with weapons and stay close to Ulysses.

### Book XXII

_The killing of the suitors—The maids who have misconducted themselves are made to cleanse the cloisters and are then hanged._

The beggar strikes Antinous with an arrow. Shocked, the suitors curse him (they think he killed by mistake). But the beggar reveals his identity and vows to kill them. Eurylochus tries diplomacy, says they were indeed wrong. Ulysses declines and is ready to attack them. Eurylochus asks the suitors to take out their swords. Ulysses asks Telemachus to bring shields, spears and helmets from the store house. Eumaeus and Philoetius are armed. Ulysses is puzzled to see the suitors arming themselves and deduces either some women or Melanthius is responsible. Eumaeus and Philoetius finds Melanthius in the store house and subdues him. Minerva, in the form of Mentor, arrives at the scene and is threatened for siding with Ulysses. This makes her furious and she rebukes Ulysses that his strength has waned. The two sides fight. Ulysses and his men kill several suitors. Minerva protects Ulysses and his men from harm. Telemachus saves Phemius and Medon from Ulysses. All other suitors are killed. Ulysses then asks Eurycleia to bring the women who have misconducted.  Telemachus, Eumaeus and Philoetius, along with the women, take out the dead bodies. Later, the women are killed.

### Book XXIII

_Penelope eventually recognizes her husband—Early in the morning Ulysses, Telemachus, Eumaeus, and Philoetius leave the town._

Eurycleia rushes to tell Penelope about Ulysses's homecoming. Penelope refuses to believe. Eurycleia recounts everything that happened, Penelope is joyous, but still considers the possible of a god disguising as the beggar. She goes down and looks at Ulysses. Telemachus reprimands her for standing so far from her husband. Later, she tricks him to revealing a secret only they know, thus proving his identity. Ulysses asks his men to raise songs so that the people will think it is a wedding, and not a battlefield. At night, Penelope recounts her stories and sufferings in his absence. Ulysses recounts his tales of adventure.

_The ghosts of the suitors in hades—Ulyses and his men go to the house of Laertes—The people of Ithaca come out to attack Ulysses, but Minerva concludes a peace._

In the land of Hades, the spirit of Achilles and that of Agamemnon converse. They discuss their manner of death. Agamemnon praises Achilles, says even in death he was well loved—Thetis and the goddesses came to mourn. Agamemnon is suprised to see Amphimedon. Agamemnon reminds him the time he and Menelaus came to persuade Ulysses to come to war. Amphimedon recounts the story of Ulysses's homecoming. Agamemnon praises Penelope.

Ulysses sets out for his father's farm with Telemachus, Eumaeus and Philoetius. He asks them to go to the house and get a pig for dinner, while he intends to see his father. When he sees the old man in rags, he sobs. He wonders whether to rush, reveal and cry or be crafty; however chooses the latter. He feigns to be a friend of Ulysses. But when the old man breaks down sobbing, he rushes to embrace him and reveals his identity. He shows the scar and recounts shared memories as proof.

Meanwhile, Antinous's father persuades a group of people to attack Ulysses. One of them reveals an immortal being in the form of Mentor sided with Ulysses, thus the death of suitors is god's will. More of half of the men are convinced and leaves. The remaining ones come to attack Ulysses. Laertes is joyous when Telemachus promises not to degrade the family's name. As they are about to fight, Minerva intervenes and concludes a peace.
