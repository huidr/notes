### Book I—Ulysses

_The gods in council—Minerva's visit to Ithaca—The challenge from Telemachus to the suitors._

Ulysses has been stranded alone on an island for years, held captive by a nymph Calypso, who is in love with him. He is also hiding from Neptune who is angry with him for having blinded his son Polyphemus.

On Mt. Olympus, gods agree Ulysses would reach home. Minerva descends, disguising as Mentes (Ulysses's old friend), and counsels Telemachus to protect Penelope and the land from the suitors. Later, Telemachus asks the suitors to leave.

### Book II

_Assembly of the people of Ithaca—Speeches of Telemachus and of the suitors—Telemachus makes his preparations and starts for Pylos with Minerva disguised as mentor._

The suitors have been feeding on the wealth of Penelope. With new courage and confidence offered by Minerva, Telemachus gathers an assembly and asks the suitors to leave. Antinous blames it on Penelope who promised to marry one of the suitors when she has finished her weaving a shroud but has been undoing each day's weaving to postpone the wedding indefinitely.

Telemachus wishes for a ship. Minerva, now disguising herself as Telemachus, gathers a ship and crew. The old nurse Eurycleia implores Telemachus not to venture into the sea like his father did and died, but he assures her that a god is with him and asks her not to tell his mother about his journey unless inquired because he doesn't want her mother to lose her beauty by shedding tears.

### Book III

_Telemachus visits Nestor at Pylos._

Telemachus and Minerva, disguised as mentor, reaches the land of Nestor where they witness a large ceremonial sacrifices to Neptune. Nestor has little information about Ulysses, but narrates how the Achaeans went different ways after the war. Agamemnon had left his cousin Aegisthus to rule in his stead during the Trojan War, but Aegisthus seized the throne and became the lover of Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra. Upon his return, Agamemnon was killed by the usurper; the king's death was then avenged by his son Orestes, and daughter Electra.

Nestor offers lodging for the night and a chariot and the help of his son Pisistratus for his journey to Sparta to meet Menelaus. Minerva flies away as an eagle, and Nestor makes sacrifice to honor her.

### Book IV

_The visit to King Minelaus, who tells his story—Meanwhile the suitors in Ithaca plot against Telemachus._

The travelers reach Sparta. There is a feast for the wedding of Menelaus's daughter to Achilles's son. Menelaus and Helen recount some anecdotes of Ulysses's bravery and wit such as once, disguising as a beggar, infiltrated Troy alone. Menelaus is shocked to hear about Telemachus's present life. He recounts his return home, how he got stranded on the island of Pharos owing to insufficient sacrifice to gods, how he and his men wrestled with the shape-shifting god Proteus and forced him to tell him how to leave the island and about his friends. Ajax would have lived if not for his boast; Neptune killed him when he boasted not even gods could kill him. Upon reaching, Agamemnon kissed his native land and was invited to a feast by his cousin who later killed him. Ulysses was stranded on an island with no ship or crew.

Back in Ithaca, the suitors plan to assassinate Telemachus upon his return. Penelope is in distress, but Minerva lets her know that she is with her son and will protect him.

### Book V

_Calypso—Ulysses reaches Scheria on a raft._

Jove decides Odysseus leave the island and reach Scheria but his journey will be perilous. Mercury visits Calypso who is furious to learn of Jove's will. She taunts the double standard of male gods, who philander with mortal women but deny the same freedom to goddesses. She grudgingly agrees to let him go. Later she finds him weeping. He is in disbelief that Calypso would free him. Calypso tells him that the road ahead would be hard and if he knew what lay ahead, he would stay. Nevertheless he chooses to leave and Calypso asks him to build a raft and supplies tools and clothes for his journey.

Ulysses sails the raft but Neptune torments him on the sea. When his ship breaks, he swims. Minerva and a sea nymph to his rescue. Finally he reaches the shore.

### Book VI

_The meeting between Nausicaa and Ulysses._

Scheria is inhabited by Phaeacians. Minerva lures Nausicaa (king Alcinous's daughter) and her maids to come near the shore where Ulysses has been sleeping. Ulysses is woken up by the sounds of the women but they, except Nausicaa, scatter when they see a man tired, shaggy and naked save for some leaves. Ulysses pleads with her for help. She gives him clothes and he washes himself in a river. She gives directions to her house but he must enter alone and ask queen Arete for help.

### Book VII

_Reception of Ulysses at the palace of King Alcinous._

Disguising as a small girl, Minerva takes Ulysses to Arete's place. She cloaks him in a dark mist to avoid being seen and asks him to not talk to the people. Upon meeting Alcinous and Arete, he pleads for help. Arete is suspicious for he is wearing clothes she recognises. When asked, he narrates his story. Impressed by Ulysses's sense of respect and honor toward his daughter, Alcinous wishes Ulysses to marry her but agrees to provide a ship for his home return.

### Book VIII

_Banquet in the house of Alcinous—The games._

Alcinous gathers the Phaeacians; Minerva helps rouse interest. Alcinous declares a feast would be held when they have found a ship and crew for the wanderer. During the celebration, the bard Demodocus sings the legend of a verbal battle between Agamemnon and Ulysses during the Trojan war and their return journey, moving Ulysses to tears, which although he tries to hide it, Alcinous notices and proposes an athletic competition to distract the crowd.

One champion of the competition invites Ulysses to take part which he declines citing his weariness. On being teased, he joins the competition and wins it. Later, Ulysses asks Demodocus to sing about the wooden horse. When the bard sings about the Achaeans and Ulysses's bravery in defeating Troy, he weeps again. Alcinous asks him to reveal himself.

### Book IX

_Ulysses declares himself and begins his story—The Cicons, Lotophagi, and Cyclopes._

Ulysses reveals his identity and recounts his journey following the Trojan war. They sacked an island inhabited by the Cicons. Ulysses reminds his men they need to leave quickly but is ignored. The Cicons from the mainland retaliate and after a loss of many lives, they sail away but are blown off course by storms. They reach the land of lotus-eaters. Upon eating lotus, they begin to forget memories of home. Finally, Ulysses is able to convince his men to leave the place. Thus they sail off and reach the land of Cyclopes—one-eyed giants, lawless, savage and uncivilized.

One such Cyclope, Polyphemus, denies hospitality, captures and kills many of the travelers. Ulysses tells him that his name is "Noman", then offers him a drink. The drink puts him to sleep and Ulysses blinds his eye. Polyphemus screams and the other Cyclopes rush to his cave and asks him who hurt him. Polyphemus answers, "No man" and they leave. Later, Ulysses reveals his true identity, which does not surprise the giant because this episode has been prophesied. Polyphemus calls upon his father Neptune to avenge him by ensuring that Ulysses never gets home or if he does, all his men should perish and his home be troubled.

### Book X

_Aeolus, the Laestrygones, Circe._

The travelers land and stay in the home of Aeolus for a month. Aeolus, the master of winds, offers Ulysses gifts and a pouch that contains all the winds that would have otherwise blow them off course. After ten days of sailing, they see their native land in the horizon. Pleased, Ulysses falls asleep, but his men accidentally open the pouch and the winds bring them back to the home of Aeolus. Suprised, Aeolus asks them why they have come back but upon learning the truth, he is furious and ask them to be away. Then they reach the land of Laestrygonians, giant cannibals, who devour many of the travelers. After much effort, Ulysses succeeds in rowing away with the remaining men. Finally they reach the island of Aeaea where the cunning goddess Circe dwells.

Ulysses gives a half of his men under the command of Eurylochus who sets out in the forest. They hear the sweet voice of a woman/goddess who is working at her loom. She invites them in. All go in, except the suspicious Eurylochus, but none come out. Horrified, Eurylochus flees back to Ulysses and recounts the story. Ulysses goes into the forest, find Mercury in disguise of a young man who gives a herb that is immune to Circe's potion. Then Circe invites Ulysses to her house, gives him her potion and uses her wand to turn him into a pig. Circe deduces he is Ulysses whom Mercury prophesied would come. Ulysses forces Circle to swear she would do mischief no more to him and his men. Circle agrees, and they sleep together. Later, Circe turns his men back to human form. They live there for a year. She then tells Ulysses that before sailing home, he must first sail for the land of Hades and speak to the prophet Tiresias. He need not worry, for the North wind will take his ship there.

### Book XI

_The visit to the dead._

On the land of Hades, Ulysses  encounters ghosts of the dead. Elpenor demands a proper funeral, which Ulysses promises. Ulysses sees his mother whom he did not know had died. Tiresias tells him he could reach Ithaca but ahead lies great peril and informs him what is happening in his home. Ulysses encounters several wives and daughters, some of them boasts of having slept with gods including Jove and Neptune.

Ulysses sees his fallen comrades. Agamemnon weeps and recollects how Clytemnestra murdered him, his comrades and Cassandra. He urges Ulysses to be careful of women although he declares Penelope is virtuous. Achilles inquires about his father and son. Ulysses knows nothing of his father but tells him the exploits of his son during the Trojan war and that he safely sailed away. Great Ajax is still angry with Ulysses over Achilles's armor.

### Book XII

_The Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, the cattle of the sun._

Back on Aeaea, the travelers give Elpenor a proper funeral. Circe warns Ulysses of the upcoming perils. First, they should not listen to the Sirens who lure sailors to shipwrecks. Second, there are two potential routes to Ithaca, one through the Wandering Rocks whence no ship, except Argo with Juno's help, ever survived, the other through six-headed immortal monster Scylla and whirlpool monster Charybdis. Third, when they land on the island of Helios, they must not harm the cattle; otherwise, his ship and entire crew (except possibly himself) shall perish.

The travelers put wax into their ears, thus are immune to the sweet voices of the Sirens; however, Ulysses, being curious, listens but his body is bound tightly to the ship, so he doesn't break free. Then Ulysses chooses the route through Scylla and Charybdis where Scylla devours six of his men. Ulysses then warns their greatest danger lies in the island of Helios and suggests they go on with their journey. Eurylochus rebukes him for being cruel and denying his tired crew a supper. Everyone applauds and Ulysses yields but warns them never to touch any cattle but be content with the food given by Circe. The crew take an oath but when the food reserves are exhausted and while Ulysses is away, Eurylochus convinces them to feed on the cattle. Jove tells Helios he will strike them with thunderbolt. The ship wrecks and the crew perish. Finally Ulysses lands on the Ogygian island where Calypso dwells.
