### Book I

_The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles—Achilles withdraws from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help the Trojans—Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus_

Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back in exchange for a ransom; her father (a priest of Apollo) calls on his god who sends a plague to Achaeans; a seer reveals to Achaeans the cause of the plague.

Achilles asks Agamemnon to give up Chryseis; Agamemnon asks for Briseis if he has to give up Chryseis angering Achilles, and the two engage in a heated battle until Minerva stops Achilles from striking his weapon; Achilles goes back to this tent; Agamemnon sends Ulysses to return Chryseis.

Later, Agamemnon's men take away Briseis; Achilles withdraws from the war, cries for his mother Thetis, who emerges from the sea; Achilles sends her to ask Jove to help the Trojans; Jove declares that the Achaeans shall lose the war until the insult to Achilles's honor has been restored.

### Book II

_Jove sends a lying dream to Agamemnon, who thereon calls the chiefs in assembly, and proposes to sound the mind of his army—In the end they march to fight—Catalogue of the Achaean and Trojan forces._

Jove sends Agamemnon a dream—all gods are undivided and are with Achaeans and wish the fall of Troy—Agamemnom wakes up and narrates the dream to his advisors. To check the wills of Achaeans, however, Agamemnon asks them to prepare to return home, for 9 years of war have only brought sorrow.

Juno sends Minerva to ask Ulysses to gather will for war—for it will be all for nothing if Achaeans give up now after the demise of many Achaeans; as soldiers rush for the ships, Ulysses and Nestor inspire the troops and Agamemnon commands the army to prepare for battle.

Jove sends Iris to warn the Trojans of the uncomming battle; Troy prepares for war; Achilles and Myrmidons bow out.

### Book III

_Alexandria, also called Paris, challenges Menelaus—Helen and Priam view the Achaeans from the wall—The covenant—Paris and Menelaus fight, and Paris is worsted—Venus carries him off to save him—Scene between him and Helen._

Paris boldy strides among Trojan forces but hides when he sees Menelaus. Hector reprimands him for being more beautiful than brave, which Paris does not deny. Hector, on Paris's wishes, proposes a combat between Paris and Menelaus, and the winner takes Helen and war concludes thus. Iris informs Helen, who now yearns for her former husband. Helen and Priam watches the battle, and Priam enquires about the Achaeans he sees—Agamemnon, Ulysses, Ajax.

Priam takes the covenant. Combat begins; Menelaus gets the upper hand, strangles him until Venus intervenes to rescue Paris. Venus then asks Helen to stay with Paris. Helen rebukes Venus—it's unfair for Menelaus has won, and Venus is unfit to tread on Olympus for having suggested this—but is frightened.

Helen joins Paris at his bed. She initially rebukes him for losing to Menelaus after having bragged he was the better man in battle but Paris blames it on Minerva for assisting his foe. They make love. Meanwhile, Agamemnon looks for Paris in vain and declares his brother's victory.

### Book IV

_A quarrel in Olympus—Minerva goes down and persuades Fandarus to violate the oaths by wounding Menelaus with an arrow—Agamemnon makes a speech and sends for Machaon—He then goes about among his captains and upbraids Ulysses and Sthenelus, who each of them retort fiercely—Diomed checks Sthenelus, and the two hosts then engage, with great slaughter on either side._

Gods of Olympus quarrel taking sides. Jove declares war is over and Menelaus takes Helen back. Juno protests that as she would not object if her favorite cities get destroyed, Jove should not object if his favorite city (Troy) gets destroyed. Jove yields and sends Miverva to entice Troy to break their oaths.

Minerva tempts Pandarus into striking his bow at Menelaus, who is only wounded (Minerva prevents a mortal wound) and his wounds are tended to. Agamemnon praises and scorns his captains to attack—among them, Ulysses and Sthenelus retort—the battle resumes as death befalls heavily on both sides. Apollo entices Hector to rush on the foe and reminds him Achilles is not fighting.

### Book V

_The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus, continues fighting—He kills Pandarus and wounds Aeneas—Venus rescues Aeneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him to the care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended by her mother Dione—Mars encourages the Trojans, and Aeneas returns to the fight cured of his wound—Minerva and Juno help the Achaeans, and by the advice of the former Diomed wounds Mars, who returns to Olympus to get cured._

With Minerva's grace, Diomed crushes his Trojan opponents; however, she tells him not to fight any god except Venus, whom he should spear, in case she comes. Aeneas asks Pandarus to strike Diomed who is rampaging the Trojans. Pandarus recognizes Diomed and deduces a god must be with him. Aeneas offers to share his chariot with Pandarus; they advance toward Diomed.

Diomed kills Pandarus and wounds Aeneas who might have died unless his mother Venus intervenes. Diomed chases and wounds Venus who bleeds; he rebukes her to stay away from war for her job is to beguile silly women. Venus screams, drops Aeneas, and flees to her mother. Apollo intervenes, saves Aeneas, reminds Diomed that he is mortal and should not engage with gods, and brings Mars to fight for the Trojans because an Achaean wounded his sister.

With Mars on their side, the Trojans fight the Achaeans who are now beginning to fall back. Juno asks Jove to allow her to hit Mars, Jove asks her to send Minerva instead. With Minerva's grace, Diomed wounds Mars, who fless to Olympus. Jove says: of all the gods, he hates Mars the most for being double-faced and that he inherited Juno's stubborness.

_Observation:_ The gods flee when they are wounded; this contrasts with Diomed's reaction after getting wounded.

### Book VI

_Glaucus and Diomed—The story of Bellerophon—Hector and Andromche._

Menelaus catches a Trojan charioteer who begs for mercy and promises ransom. As Menelaus is moved to grant the request, Agamemnon intervenes and together they kill the Trojan. Priam's son Helenus advices Hector to return to Troy and ask the queen to make an offering for Minerva.

Diomed encounters Glaucus, wonders about his lineage. On knowing their forefathers' friendship and exchange of gifts, Diomed offers friendship and they exchange armor (Diomed gets a gold armor while giving away a bronze one).

Hector rebukes Paris for staying away from the battle, then visits his wife Andromache who fears for him and asks him to withdraw from the battle. He declines and then moves to hug his son. As he return to battle, Andromache weeps as if he would not return again.

### Book VII

_Hector and Ajax fight—Hector is getting worsted when night comes on and parts them—They exchange presents—The burial of the dead, and the building of a wall round their ships by the Achaeans—The Achaeans buy their wine of Agamemnon and Menelaus_

Hector and Paris enter the battlefield. Alarmed, Minerva and Apollo converse about what to do; the latter suggests a duel to end the day. Minerva telepathically contacts seer Helenus, and consequently Hector challenges the strongest Achaean to fight him. Menelaus volunteers but is rebuked and stopped by Agamemnon, who himself volunteers along with other Achaeans. Ajax is selected.

Hector is intimidated but fights boldly. However, Ajax blocks his blows and is close to wounding Hector. But as night falls, the two agree to end the duel and exchange goodwill presents.

A Trojan advisor suggests returning Helen. Paris objects but offers treasure he took with her and more. Diomed objects to this purposal and all Achaeans stand with him, but agree on a day for the burial of the dead. Achaeans build a wall around their ships. Neptune objects to this wall but Jove assures he can wash it away as they leave.

### Book VIII

_Jove forbids the gods to interfere further—There is an even fight till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory in favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans within their wall—Juno and Minerva set out to help the Trojans: Jove sends Iris to turn them back, but later on he promises Juno that she shall have her way in the end—Hector's triumph is stayed by nightfall—The Trojans bivouac on the plain._

Jove forbids the other gods from interfering in the war anymore, then walks off to take charge. As the mortals fight, Jove spurs the Trojans as they chase the Achaeans to their ships. As the Achaeans stand on the verge of getting wiped out, Juno upbraids Neptune but neither have the strength to defy Jove.

Agamemnon prays to Jove for the lives of Achaeans. Touched, Jove sends a sign of assent in the form of an eagle. Teucer woes the Trojans, almost hit Hector with his arrow but with Apollo's intervention, kills his charioteer instead. As Achaeans begin to kill some Trojans, Jove urges Hector who then drives out his foes. Juno and Minerva defy Jove, who sends Iris to tell them Hector would not stop until Achilles returns to battle.

As night falls, Hector makes a speech, lights out flames to ensure Achaeans do not sail away. Victory looks imminent.

### Book IX

_The Embassy to Achilles._

Disheartened, Agamemnon proposes to leave Troy; however, Diomed rebukes him telling he has no valor. Diomed declares he will stay and fight even if Agamemnon leaves. Then on Nestor's advice, Agamemnon decides to yield to Achilles, sends his men who found Achilles and Patroclus by the sea.

Odysseus asks him to come back; Achilles says he is sailing away in three days, declines all gifts. He encourages Phoenix to come with him but gives him the liberty to decide, but Phoenix tells him he will not stay without him. As Ajax whines about Achilles's savagery and remorselessness, Achilles says he will not fight unless Hector raids his tent.

As Odysseus relay the news to Agamemnon, Diomed reprimands that Agamemnon's choices have only boosted Achilles's pride and suggests they should fight with or without him.

_Background:_ Phoenix, following a dispute with his father, fled to Peleus and became his vassal. Then he became an instructor and mentor of Achilles.

### Book X

_Ulysses and Diomed go out as spies, and meet Dolon, who gives them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what he had told them, kill Rhesus king of the Thracians and take his horses._

In the night, Agamemnon and Menelaus could not sleep and converse on how to save the Achaeans. Nestor gathers the Achaeans and ask for anyone who would spy on the Trojans camped nearby. Diomed volunteers but asks for a partner. Many volunteered; fearing for Menelaus who volunteered, Agamemnon asks Diomed to choose his favorite partner; Diomed chooses Ulysses.

In the Trojan camp, Hector asks for a spy and Dolon volunteers. Hector promises him the horse of Achilles if he succeeds in spying. Ulysses sees Dolon first, whom they capture and get information of Trojan camps out of him. Diomed kills him and other Trojans until Minerva asks him to stop lest he should invoke some god to rouse the Trojans; the spys return. However, Apollo knowing Minerva's involvement, rouses the Trojans.

### Book XI

_In the forenoon the fight is equal, but Agamemnon turns the fortune of the day towards the Achaeans until he gets wounded and leaves the battlefield—Hector then drives everything before him till he is wounded by Diomed—Paris wounds Diomed—Ulysses, Nestor, and Idomeneus perform prodigies of valour—Machaon is wounded—Nestor drives him off in his chariot—Achilles sees the pair driving towards the camp and sends Patroclus to ask who it is that is wounded—This is the beginning of evil for Patroclus—Nestor makes a long speech._

The battle resumes; Agamemnon kills many foes and drives the Trojans back to ther gates. Jove, through Iris, sends a message to Hector to not engage with Agamemnon unless he is wounded or retreats. Hector rages on the Achaeans until Diomed fights him and nearly knocks him out with a spear to his helmet. Hector retreats.

As the battle rages on, many Achaean fighters are wounded and forced to retreat. Paris wounds Diomed with an arrow in his foot; however, the undaunted Diomed rebukes him. Ulysses is wounded and about to be overwhelmed but Ajax comes to the rescue and drives the Trojans away. Hector rushes to block Ajax's advances while taking care he does not engage with him directly. Jove puts fear into the heart of Ajax forcing him to retreat; however, Ajax holds his ground.

Achilles sends Patroclus to identify the wounded fighter Nestor is bringing in. Nestor scorns why Achilles should care about the wounded; he asks Patroclus to convince Achilles to return, or at least Patroclus leading his troops in Achilles's armor should bring valor to the demoralized Achaeans. Patroclus encounters fellow wounded Achaeans and laments.

### Book XII

_The Trojans and their allies break the wall, led on by Hector._

Hector and Trojans march on foot toward the Achaeans for the trench before the wall blocks their chariots. They see a sign: an eagle gets bitten by the snake it is carrying. Polydamas interprets this as an omen for fall of Trojans. Hector rebukes him and thomps the wall.

The Achaeans try to defend the wall and the two Ajaxes boost their morale. Jove sends his son Sarpedon (Glaucus's cousin, together they command the Lycians) who rips a section of the wall away. Achaeans rush to block the breach and the two sides reach a temporary stalemate.

Jove lends power to Hector who lift a giant rock and smash it on the gates. The Trojans raid the Achaeans who flee to their ships.

### Book XIII

_Neptune helps the Achaeans—The feats of Idomeneus—Hector at the ships._

Satisfied, Jove leaves thinking no god will interfere; however, Neptune, furiously angry with Jove, has been watching the fall of the Achaeans whom he now pities. Neptune empowers the two Ajaxes. The fall of his grandson Amphimachus made Neptune exceedingly angry; he incites Idomeneus, who along with other Achaeans kill many Trojans.

Idomeneus kills Alcathous (Aeneas's sister's husband); Deiphobus relays this to Aeneas and asks him to defend her sister's husband's body. Undaunted, Idomeneus fights Aeneas. Menelaus kills Pisander and rebukes Jove for siding with the prideful.

As Trojans continue to fall, Polydamas successfully convinces Hector to withdraw a bit. Paris incites Hector who finds out many Trojans are dead or wounded. Jove then drives on the Trojans; Hector advances and encounters Great Ajax who delivers a brave speech. Hector promises to kill him and the armies clash again.

### Book XIV

_Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and is rebuked by Ulysses—Juno beguiles Jupiter—Hector is wounded._

Nestor hears the cries of the battle and gathers the wounded Achaean leaders. Agamemnon, feeling that Achaeans will fall, suggests sailing away. Ulysses contemptuously rejects the idea; Diomed suggests they go front, not to fight for they are wounded, but to inspire their fellowmen. On the way, Neptune assures Agamemnon that Trojans shall retreat.

Juno was gladden at the sight of her brother Neptune on Achaean's side. She asks Venus to make her as beautiful as one can be, and bribes Sleep, promising his marriage to Pasithea (one of the Grances), to help her. She charms Jove on Ida. When asked where she intends to go, she lies that she wants to see Oceanus and mother Tethys. Jove suggests they make love; to avoid a scandle, they hide in a cloud, making love, and Jove sleeps. Juno informs Neptune that Jove is asleep.

Neptune inspires the Achaeans, provides them the best armor. Great Ajax crushes Hector who begins to spit up blood. Hector retreats and the Achaeans get a upper hand.

### Book XV

_Jove awakes, tells Apollo to heal Hector, and the Trojans again become victorious._

Jove wakes up and scolds Juno, but she lies that Neptune helped the Achaeans on its own out of pity. Jove puts her to work to undo Neptune's exploits which she agrees. Jove then sends Iris to call off a reluctant Neptune, and asks Apollo to heal Hector.

Hector rages again, to the surprise of the Achaeans who thought him to be dead. Apollo fills the trench and knocks down the wall for the Trojans's chariots. Nestor prays to Jove; neither side gains ground. Patroclus, who was tending to the wounded Eurypylus, rushes in the hope of persuading Achilles to fight.

Ajax urges his younger half-brother Teucer to aim at Hector. Teucer would have vanquished Hector; however, Jove breaks his bowstring. Distraught as Jove is against them, but undaunted, Ajax rallies and commands the Achaeans. With Jove's help, Hector reaches a ship. Great Ajax, alone on the deck, fights off the Trojans.

### Book XVI

_Fire being now thrown on the ship of Protesilaus, Patroclus fights in the armour of Achilles—He drives the Trojans back, but is in the end killed by Euphorbus and Hector._

Patroclus tearly begs Achilles to return to battle, or at least allow him to wear his armor and fight. Moved, Achilles allows him to fight but warns to only drive the Trojans away from their ships and not to venture further. Achilles delivers a speech to the Myrmidons; Patroclus and Automedon to lead them; Achilles prays to Jove.

As Patroclus and the Myrmidons rage and kill, the Trojans begin to flee to confusion. Jove wonders if he should save his son Sarpedon but Juno argues it would set a bad example for other gods. Sarpedon charges and throws spears (and misses) at Patroclus—and is killed by Patroclus. Sorrowful Glaucus prays to Apollo and reproaches Hector; the Trojans and Lycians fight the Myrmidons and Achaeans around the body of Sarpedon.

The Achaeans take Sarpedon's armor but Jove sends Apollo to take the body home for burial. Patroclus chases Hector and the Trojans to their gates. Hector wonders whether to continue fighting or flee inside the gates. Apollo incites Hector. Apollo then strikes Patroclus in the back, knocking away his armor and weapons. A young Troojan then stabs Patroclus in the back. Hector finishes Patroclus with a spear to the gut; however, Patroclus, as he lays dying, warns Hector that Achilles will bring him down.

### Book XVII

_The fight around the body of Patroclus._

Both sides rage over Patroclus's body. Menelaus kills Euphorbus, who wanted to re-stab Patroclus to take glory, but calls in Great Ajax to help him in driving off Hector. Glaucus scorns Hector for abandoning Sarpedon's body and declares Great Ajax is braver than him. Hector gets Achilles's armor and puts it on, much to Jove's disapproval because he has no right to the famous armor, and intends to take Patroclus's body and feed it to the dogs of Troy.

On Jove's approval, Minerva takes the form of Phoenix and incites Menelaus to save Patroclus's body; Menelaus wishes Minerva shall give him strength. The mention of her name before any of other gods pleases her; she gives him strength and more. Apollo keeps spurring Hector who, alongside Aeneas and others, briefly try to seize Achilles's horses.

Menelaus asks Antilochus to relay the sad news to Achilles so that he may come to rescue the body. Menelaus declares Patroclus was the bravest of the Achaeans and shall be sorely missed. Antilochus, with tears and struck with horror, runs off. Menelaus and Meriones lifted the body and carried it away while the two Ajaxes hold off Hector, Aeneas and the Trojans.

_Discussion_: Menelaus's dilemma of honor: should he stand against Hector and die or desert Patroclus? He makes a strategic significant decision (a rare instance where no god is prompted) to seek Great Ajax's help. Meanwhile, Hector despises Glaucus for saying Great Ajax is braver than him.

### Book XVIII

_The grief of Achilles over Patroclus—The visit of Thetis to Vulcan and the armour that he made for Achilles._

Achilles has a bad feeling that Patroclus might be dead. When he learns it from Antilochus, he breaks down that Antilochus holds his hands less he should slit his own throat. Thetis rises from the sea and weeps that his end is also near as it will come soon after Hector's fall; however, she asks him to wait until the next day as she will bring him an armor from Vulcan.

Minerva incites Achilles to join the war; his presence uplifts the Trojans; the body of Patroclus is regained; Polydamus suggests retreating as Achilles now has a chance to break inside Troy; Hector rebukes him, declares he will stay and the Trojans applaud him.

At night, the Achaeans mourns Patroclus. Achilles vows Patroclus will not be buried until Hector is slain. Vulcan welcomes Thetis. Because Thetis has helped him in the past, he gladly makes the armor.

### Book XIX

_Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight._

Thetis delivers Achilles's new armor and promises to prevent Patroclus's body from decay. Assembling his Myrmidons and leaders of the army together, he reconciles with Agamemnon and intends to join war immediately. Agamemnon promises to deliver his gifts and Briseis immediately; Achilles is indifferent to the gifts, but wants to fight. Odysseus suggests eating good first.

Agamemnon delivers the gifts. Briseis weeps for Patroclus (who seemingly promised her marriage to Achilles?) but Achilles will not eat. Minerva gives Achilles immunity to hunger. Achilles puts on his armor.

As Achilles prepares for departure, his horses (as Juno gives them voice) tells him they will serve him but cannot fight Achilles's fate that is coming soon. Achilles isn't moved; he accepts his fate.

### Book XX

_The gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from the hill Callicolone, and the barrow of Hercules—A fight between Achilles and Aeneas is interrupted by Neptune, who saves Aeneas—Achilles kills many Trojans._

Jove holds a council and gives the gods the liberty to choose sides and join the war. Juno, Minerva, Neptune, Mercury and Vulcan join the Achaeans and Mars, Apollo, Diana, Leto, Xanthus and Venus join the Trojans. Apollo incites Aeneas against Achilles. The gods decide to watch rather than directly join in.

Aeneas reveals his lineage to Achilles; they fight: Aeneas's spear is stopped by Achilles's shield; Achilles's spear nearly touches Aeneas's body, frightening him. As Achilles nearly kills him, Neptune decides to save Aeneas so that his fate remains unchanged.

Apollo warns Hector not to challenge Achilles on any account. Afraid, Hector steps away. Achilles vanquishes many Trojans including Polydorus (Hector's youngest brother and the fastest) who was showing off his speed. This enrages Hector and he fights Achilles; however, Apollo saves Hector. Achilles rages on, vanquishes many Trojans.

### Book XXI

_The fight between Achilles and the river Scamander—The gods fight among themselves—Achilles drives the Trojans within their gates._

Achilles pushes the Trojan army back, drives them into the river Scamander and slaughters in huge numbers. Lycaon son of Priam begs for mercy but Achilles isn't moved. The dead bodies Achilles killed clog the river and this angers god Scamander.

Scamander overwhelms Achilles with waves and whirlpools; however, Vulcan, on Juno's command, combats Scamander with fire until the river god swears to not interfere with the fate of Troy. Minerva knocks Mars out and injures Venus when she tries to help him. Juno humiliates Diana, sending her running home. Neptune rebukes Apollo for siding with the Trojans who insulted them and failed to deliver gifts after building their walls; however, Apollo declines the combat and retreats to protect Troy.

As Achilles continue to rout the Trojans, their gates open, on Priam's command, to save them. Apollo distracts Achilles and saves Agenor from him.

### Book XXII

_The death of Hector._

Apollo questions Achilles why he chases a god; Achilles mocks him for robbing him of his glory and for saving Troy. Despite the pleas of his parents, Hector stands at the gate; however, he regrets not listening to Polydamas. When Achilles approaches him, Hector flees in fear and is chased by Achilles.

Taking the form of Deiphobus, Minerva and convinces Hector to make a stand and fight together. Hector agrees; however, he asks Achilles to let the winner give up the body of the dead; Achilles declines and rebukes him. Achilles throws his spear first, and Hector dodges. Unbeknownst to him, Minerva brings the spear back to Achilles. Hector's spear is bounded off from Achilles's shield. Hector calls to Deiphobus for another spear, but finds no one; thus, he realizes his fate is upon him.

Hector charges with his sword; Achilles spears him through a hole in the armor (his armor) and slashes his neck. Dying, Hector begs Achilles to ransom his body back to his parents; Achilles declines and drags his body using his chariot back to the ships. Andromache learns of the news and faints. The whole city mourns.

### Book XXIII

_The funeral of Patroclus, and the funeral games._

Achilles and the Myrmidons mourn Patroclus. He vows he will not wash Hector's blood off his body unitl Patroclus is buried. He falls alseep and Patroclus's spirit visits him in a dream, asking why he has forgotten him. His spirit cannot enter the land of Hades until his body is buried. Recalling their shared childhood, Patroclus asks that their bones be put in the same jar. Achilles reaches out to embrace Patroclus but the body vanishes. Achilles wakes up.

The Achaeans build a pyre for Patroclus and surrounds his body with slain animals and enemies. Achilles cuts a lock of his hair and burns it with Patroclus. Achilles set dogs on Hector's body but Venus and Apollo keeps the body safe. The next day, Achilles organizes funeral games.

### Book XXIV

_Priam ransoms the body of Hector—Hector's funeral._

Achilles, still grieving, drags the body of Hector around the tomb whenever he misses his comrade. Gods quarrel over this. Jove offers a compromise: Achilles to give up the body for a ransom, which Priam will bring in person and alone. On Jove's command, Thetis convinces Achilles to give up the body and Iris gives the message to Priam.

Although Hecuba scorns the idea and curses Achilles, Priam is ready to go, but prays to Jove for a sign of approval. Jove sends a huge eagle. On Jove's command, Mercury disguises himself as Achilles's squire and guides Priam safely to Achilles.

Priam kneels and kisses Achilles's hands. Priam's appeal touches him and they weep together; however when Priam suggests he sail home safely to his own father, Achilles warns him not to tempt his rage. Achilles provides him hospitality and pledges to hold off attacking until Hector is buried.

Fearing Priam might be captured, Mercury wakes him before dawn and guides him to Troy. There, they mourn. After nine days of mourning, his body is burned.
