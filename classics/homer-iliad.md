### Book I

_The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles—Achilles withdraws from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help the Trojans—Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus_

Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back in exchange for a ransom; her father (a priest of Apollo) calls on his god who sends a plague to Achaeans; a seer reveals to Achaeans the cause of the plague.

Achilles asks Agamemnon to give up Chryseis; Agamemnon asks for Briseis if he has to give up Chryseis angering Achilles, and the two engage in a heated battle until Minerva stops Achilles from striking his weapon; Achilles goes back to this tent; Agamemnon sends Ulysses to return Chryseis.

Later, Agamemnon's men take away Briseis; Achilles withdraws from the war, cries for his mother Thetis, who emerges from the sea; Achilles sends her to ask Jove to help the Trojans; Jove declares that the Achaeans shall lose the war until the insult to Achilles's honor has been restored.

### Book II

_Jove sends a lying dream to Agamemnon, who thereon calls the chiefs in assembly, and proposes to sound the mind of his army—In the end they march to fight—Catalogue of the Achaean and Trojan forces._

Jove sends Agamemnon a dream—all gods are undivided and are with Achaeans and wish the fall of Troy—Agamemnom wakes up and narrates the dream to his advisors. To check the wills of Achaeans, however, Agamemnon asks them to prepare to return home, for 9 years of war have only brought sorrow.

Juno sends Minerva to ask Ulysses to gather will for war—for it will be all for nothing if Achaeans give up now after the demise of many Achaeans; as soldiers rush for the ships, Ulysses and Nestor inspire the troops and Agamemnon commands the army to prepare for battle.

Jove sends Iris to warn the Trojans of the uncomming battle; Troy prepares for war; Achilles and Myrmidons bow out.

### Book III

_Alexandria, also called Paris, challenges Menelaus—Helen and Priam view the Achaeans from the wall—The covenant—Paris and Menelaus fight, and Paris is worsted—Venus carries him off to save him—Scene between him and Helen._

Paris boldy strides among Trojan forces but hides when he sees Menalaus. Hector reprimands him for being more beautiful than brave, which Paris does not deny. Hector, on Paris's wishes, proposes a combat between Paris and Menelaus, and the winner takes Helen and war concludes thus. Iris informs Helen, who now yearns for her former husband. Helen and Priam watches the battle, and Priam enquires about the Achaeans he sees—Agamemnon, Ulysses, Ajax.

Priam takes the covenant. Combat begins; Menelaus gets the upper hand, strangles him until Venus intervenes to rescue Paris. Venus then asks Helen to stay with Paris. Helen rebukes Venus—it's unfair for Menelaus has won, and Venus is unfit to tread on Olympus for having suggested this—but is frightened.

Helen joins Paris at his bed. She initially rebukes him for losing to Menelaus after having bragged he was the better man in battle but Paris blames it on Minerva for assisting his foe. They make love. Meanwhile, Agamemnon looks for Paris in vain and declares his brother's victory.

### Book IV

_A quarrel in Olympus—Minerva goes down and persuades Fandarus to violate the oaths by wounding Menelaus with an arrow—Agamemnon makes a speech and sends for Machaon—He then goes about among his captains and upbraids Ulysses and Sthenelus, who each of them retort fiercely—Diomed checks Sthenelus, and the two hosts then engage, with great slaughter on either side._

Gods of Olympus quarrel taking sides. Jove declares war is over and Menelaus takes Helen back. Juno protests that as she would not object if her favorite cities get destroyed, Jove should not object if his favorite city (Troy) gets destroyed. Jove yields and sends Miverva to entice Troy to break their oaths.

Minerva tempts Pandarus into striking his bow at Menelaus, who is only wounded (Minerva prevents a mortal wound) and his wounds are tended to. Agamemnon praises and scorns his captains to attack—among them, Ulysses and Sthenelus retort—the battle resumes as death befalls heavily on both sides. Apollo entices Hector to rush on the foe and reminds him Achilles is not fighting.

### Book V

_The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus, continues fighting—He kills Pandarus and wounds Aeneas—Venus rescues Aeneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him to the care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended by her mother Dione—Mars encourages the Trojans, and Aeneas returns to the fight cured of his wound—Minerva and Juno help the Achaeans, and by the advice of the former Diomed wounds Mars, who returns to Olympus to get cured._

With Minerva's grace, Diomed crushes his Trojan opponents; however, she tells him not to fight any god except Venus, whom he should spear, in case she comes. Aeneas asks Pandarus to strike Diomed who is rampaging the Trojans. Pandarus recognizes Diomed and deduces a god must be with him. Aeneas offers to share his chariot with Pandarus; they advance toward Diomed.

Diomed kills Pandarus and wounds Aeneas who might have died unless his mother Venus intervenes. Diomed chases and wounds Venus who bleeds; he rebukes her to stay away from war for her job is to beguile silly women. Venus screams, drops Aeneas, and flees to her mother. Apollo intervenes, saves Aeneas, reminds Diomed that he is mortal and should not engage with gods, and brings Mars to fight for the Trojans because an Achaean wounded his sister.

With Mars on their side, the Trojans fight the Achaeans who are now beginning to fall back. Juno asks Jove to allow her to hit Mars, Jove asks her to send Minerva instead. With Minerva's grace, Diomed wounds Mars, who fless to Olympus. Jove says: of all the gods, he hates Mars the most for being double-faced and that he inherited Juno's stubborness.

_Observation:_ The gods flee when they are wounded; this contrasts with Diomed's reaction after getting wounded.

### Book VI

_Glaucus and Diomed—The story of Bellerophon—Hector and Andromche._

Menelaus catches a Trojan charioteer who begs for mercy and promises ransom. As Menelaus is moved to grant the request, Agamemnon intervenes and together they kill the Trojan. Priam's son Helenus advices Hector to return to Troy and ask the queen to make an offering for Minerva.

Diomed encounters Glaucus, wonders about his lineage. On knowing their forefathers' friendship and exchange of gifts, Diomed offers friendship and they exchange armor (Diomed got a gold armor and gave away a bronze one).

Hector rebukes Paris for staying away from the battle, then visits his wife Andromache who fears for him and asks him to withdraw from the battle. He declines and then moves to hug his son. As he return to battle, Andromache weeps as if he would not return again.
