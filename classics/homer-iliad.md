### Book I—Achilles withdraws from the war

_The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles—Achilles withdraws from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help the Trojans—Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus_

Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back in exchange for a ransom; her father (a priest of Apollo) calls on his god who sends a plague to Achaeans; a seer reveals to Achaeans the cause of the plague.

Achilles asks Agamemnon to give up Chryseis; Agamemnon asks for Briseis if he has to give up Chryseis angering Achilles, and the two engage in a heated battle until Minerva stops Achilles from striking his weapon; Achilles goes back to this tent.

Later, Agamemnon's men take away Briseis; Achilles withdraws from the war, cries for his mother Thetis, who emerges from the sea; Achilles sends her to ask Jove to help the Trojans; Jove declares that the Achaeans shall lose the war until the insult to Achilles's honor has been restored.
