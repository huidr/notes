## [_The House of the Dead_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_(novel)) by Fyodor Dostoevsky

### Part I

1. **Ten Years A Convict.** Siberia has steppes, mountains, forests and small towns. The inhabitants are simple, devoid of liberal ideas. The climate is excellent. Alexander Petrovitch Goriantchikoff was an exile, condemned to hard labor for uxoricide. Then he gave teaching lessons in the town. The narrator visited him once during one such lesson; he became confused as if he had been detected in a crime. He seemed to live in his own world, ignorant of the affairs of the town. Sometimes the narrator would look up and saw lights in his window; he wondered if Petrovitch was reading or writing. After three months, the narrator heard news of his death. After some effort, he found some manuscripts left by Petrovitch sketching his life as ten years a convict. These memoirs constitute the rest of the novel.
2. **The Dead-House.**
