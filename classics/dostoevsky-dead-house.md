## [_The House of the Dead_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_(novel)) by Fyodor Dostoevsky

### Part I

**Introduction.** Siberia had steppes, mountains, forests and small towns. The inhabitants were simple, devoid of liberal ideas. The climate was excellent. Alexander Petrovitch Goriantchikoff (ten years convict) was an exile, condemned to hard labor for uxoricide. Then he gave teaching lessons in the town. The narrator visited him once during one such lesson; he became confused as if he had been detected in a crime. He seemed to live in his own world, ignorant of the affairs of the town. Sometimes the narrator would look up and saw lights in his window; he wondered if Petrovitch was reading or writing. After three months, the narrator heard news of his death. After some effort, he found some manuscripts left by Petrovitch sketching his life as ten years a convict. These memoirs constitute the rest of the novel.

1. **The Dead House.** Criminals in prison were categorized into classes based on their crimes and labor. Describes the terrible suffering of never being alone and loss of liberty in prison. The convicts dreamt aloud and they engaged in robbery, smuggling, drinking and labor. The Bible was the only book allowed in prison and the prisoners received alms.
2. **First Impressions.** Talks about Akimych, a clever convict who learned all trades in prison. The Poles and Russian nobles (narrator included) were hated by other convicts and the major looked down upon the convicts as personal enemies. The other prisoners were hostile toward the narrator due to his noble status. The narrator recounts a parricide.
3. **First Impressions.** Prisoners loved money almost as much as freedom but money couldn't stay long in one hand (either stolen or consfiscated to the major). Almost anyone in the prison could steal.
4. **First Impressions.** From the first day in prison, the nattator noticed that all non-prisoners had an exaggerated view of the prisoners (as if they were to throw a knife anytime) and the prisoners were aware of this and that they were feared. Prisoners respected those (generals) who didn't fear them and could come alone without escorts. The narrator talks about different prisoners he met and describes meeting Alei (an extraordinary intelligent tactful handsome young man) as one of the best meetings in his life. Alei helped him at his labor and he taught Alei how to read and write in Russian. He recounts how Alei left the prison (Alei thanking Alexander for all he did for him like a father). The Poles remained exclusive, disliked the Russians who disliked them in return.
5. **The First Month.** Akimych arranged for the narrator to get beef and food from outside because prison food was horrid. The narrator recounts how life in prison turned out different than what he observed initially. He talks about A&mdash;v (a very base and vile man who thought a convict should not be ashamed to crawl at ease) who was closed to and would report things to the major who then treated the prisoners rather harshly. He talks about why money was important and was the source of power in prison&mdash;though a prisoner could live without it, the one who lived with money lived much easier. The prisoners were great dreamers and they dreamt of freedom.
6. **The First Month.** The narrator had brought some money with him when he came to prison but he readily gave them away when other prisoners asked him. Soon, they began to lose respect of him (because he gave money readily) but he couldn't stop giving them money. The narrator then recounts the people from outside the prison who were generous, who would find a brother in the unfortunate. There was one such widow who treated the prisoners with hospitality as if they were one of hers. Then he recounts his first labor experience: they did work near a river bank and he had a hard time fitting in; he wanted to stay a nobleman in their eyes to not lose their respect&mdash;independent and reserved but not as exclusive as the Poles. As he returned to prison, he met Sharik (prison dog) whom nobody noticed but who treated everyone as his master. He fed the dog with bread from his hand and hugged him. Soon Sharik became his faithful friend.
7. **New Acquiantances. Petrov.**
