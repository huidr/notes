### The First Major Challenge: The Revolt of 1857

1. The sepoys were displeased with the East India Company for various reasons—threat to their religion and caste system (including loss of caste system beyond the sea), rumor of incoming Christian conversion, low salary, racism in job promotion, farmer families impoverished due to revenue system. Before the great revolt (sieze of Delhi) of 1857, some revolts occured (e.g. Mangal Pandey).
2. Sepoys from Meerut marched to Red Fort and compelled Bahadur Shah II to take command (as emperor of Hindustan). Several revolts followed at many places, particularly North India. Many former rulers were not enthusiastic to join the rebels but were forced to join. Only the sepoys of Madras were fully loyal to the East India Company.
3. The civil population were also affected by the Company's policies—farmers lost their land due to heavy taxes, artisans and handicraftsman lost their jobs when the Company imported and encouraged British goods. The revolt of sepoys inspired their large-scale participation. But the entire revolt appears to have been instantaneous without any firm plan or vision of the future.
4. Due to the Doctrine of Lapse, Rani Lakshmibhai of Jhansi could not pass down the heir to her adopted son. She later openly joined the rebels. Barring her and a few leaders, most other leaders were without will. Some kept switching sides according to which side had the upper hand. Bahadur Shah II himself asked the Company for his safety. The revolt was ultimately unsucessful.

### Civil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings

5. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 wasn't the first of rebellions. There had been revolts in various places since the Battle of Plassey—they were localized and isolated.
6. Major cause of the rebellions appears to have been the quick changes the Company brought in economy, administration and land revenue system. No tariffs on British imported goods but tariffs on Indian exports, increased land revenue (compared to Mughal times).
7. Tribal groups depended on forests for survival (one major way of life was shifting cultivation). The Company introduced heavy land revenue, taxes on forest products, banned shifting cultivation, restricted tribal access to forests leading to mass unemployment and impoverishment. Hence the tribal rebellions.

### Peasant Movements and Uprisings after 1857

8. Indigo Revolt of 1859-1860 in Bengal: Peasants were forced to grow indigo by being paid a low advance; the conditions were oppressive; they rebelled by not growing indigo anymore and retaliating the lathiyals sent by the planters. Peasants attacked factories and resisted police attacks. The revolt was large-scaled with unity between Hindus and Muslims—leading to success as planters closed down factories and indigo cultivation stopped.
9. Agrarian unrest in 1870s and early 1880s in Bengal: Agrarian leagues were formed in retaliation to zamindars' increased rents. The government defended zamindars whenever violence took place, otherwise maintained neutrality. Reconciliation came easy as the leagues were only against zamindars, displayed no anti-colonial sentiments and only acted within the law. Some protections came in the form of Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885.
10. Deccan peasants' boycott of moneylenders (who were mostly outsiders: Marwaris and Gujaratis) in some districts of Maharastra in the 1870s. Since there were no anti-colonial sentiments and the demands were reasonable, success came easy. Once the debt bonds were surrendered, no more violence was needed.

### Foundation of the Congress: The Myth

11. The safety-valve theory (or myth) of the foundation of the Congress—A. O. Hume under, under the direction and guidance of the Viceroy Lord Dufferin, founded the Congress to channel the emerging unrest and potential mass revolution into a safety valve. Citing this genesis, several intellectuals, extreme right-wing, liberals criticized that the Congress had been compromising and anti-national from the beginning and this played a role in their behavior afterwards.
12. This chapter takes on this myth. It argues that, by citing evidences, Hume, after his retirement from ICS in 1882, had publicly encouraged Indians to take part in politics, to unite and discuss political reforms while Dufferin was critical of the Congress for taking part in political matters and was never supportive of the movement. Dufferin and others were fearful of an Irish-type revolutionary agitation in India.

### Foundation of the Indian National Congress: The Reality

13. The early objectives of the Congress was to induct the people into politics and national feeling. Colonial critics cited the diversity of caste, religion, creed as main challenges toward this goal. The Congress leaders conceded this; nonetheless, declared that India was a nation-in-the-making. They foresaw that this nation building process would take long.
14. To bring diverse people under a national umbrella, the Congress decided their sessions be held by rotation at various cities. The mass politics was new and the people should be introduced to politics. Importance of nation-wide organization and leadership was seen. From the beginning, the Congress was organized as a parliament and the proceedings were democratic. They stood for sovereignty of the people, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, against racial discrimation.
15. The formation of the Congress was the culmination of various unrest and agitations (regarding tariffs, right for Indian judges to try Europeans, etc) in the preceding decades. In its initial stage, the Congress did not organize mass movements. Early nationalists took time to understand the nature of colonial state. Having a distinguished British ex-officer as the organizer worked in their favor for it were an Indian organizing a mass all-India anti-colonial movement, the reaction of the colonial state could have been harsh and quick.
