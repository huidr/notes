### The First Major Challenge: The Revolt of 1857

1. The sepoys were displeased with the East India Company for various reasons—threat to their religion and caste system (including loss of caste system beyond the sea), rumor of incoming Christian conversion, low salary, racism in job promotion, farmer families impoverished due to revenue system. Before the great revolt (sieze of Delhi) of 1857, some revolts occured (e.g. Mangal Pandey).
2. Sepoys from Meerut marched to Red Fort and compelled Bahadur Shah II to take command (as emperor of Hindustan). Several revolts followed at many places, particularly North India. Many former rulers were not enthusiastic to join the rebels but were forced to join. Only the sepoys of Madras were fully loyal to the East India Company.
3. The civil population were also affected by the Company's policies—farmers lost their land due to heavy taxes, artisans and handicraftsman lost their jobs when the Company imported and encouraged British goods. The revolt of sepoys inspired their large-scale participation. But the entire revolt appears to have been instantaneous without any firm plan or vision of the future.
4. Due to the Doctrine of Lapse, Rani Lakshmibhai of Jhansi could not pass down the heir to her adopted son. She later openly joined the rebels. Barring her and a few leaders, most other leaders were without will. Some kept switching sides according to which side had the upper hand. Bahadur Shah II himself asked the Company for his safety. The revolt was ultimately unsucessful.

### Civil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings

5. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 wasn't the first of rebellions. There had been revolts in various places since the Battle of Plassey—they were localized and isolated.
6. Major cause of the rebellions appears to have been the quick changes the Company brought in economy, administration and land revenue system. No tariffs on British imported goods but tariffs on Indian exports, increased land revenue (compared to Mughal times).
7. Tribal groups depended on forests for survival (one major way of life was shifting cultivation). The Company introduced heavy land revenue, taxes on forest products, banned shifting cultivation, restricted tribal access to forests leading to mass unemployment and impoverishment. Hence the tribal rebellions.

### Peasant Movements and Uprisings after 1857

8. Indigo Revolt of 1859-1860 in Bengal: Peasants were forced to grow indigo by being paid a low advance; the conditions were oppressive; they rebelled by not growing indigo anymore and retaliating the lathiyals sent by the planters. Peasants attacked factories and resisted police attacks. The revolt was large-scaled with unity between Hindus and Muslims—leading to success as planters closed down factories and indigo cultivation stopped.
9. Agrarian unrest in 1870s and early 1880s in Bengal: Agrarian leagues were formed in retaliation to zamindars' increased rents. The government defended zamindars whenever violence took place, otherwise maintained neutrality. Reconciliation came easy as the leagues were only against zamindars, displayed no anti-colonial sentiments and only acted within the law. Some protections came in the form of Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885.
10. Deccan peasants' boycott of moneylenders (who were mostly outsiders: Marwaris and Gujaratis) in some districts of Maharastra in the 1870s. Since there were no anti-colonial sentiments and the demands were reasonable, success came easy. Once the debt bonds were surrendered, no more violence was needed.

### Foundation of the Congress: The Myth

11. The safety-valve theory (or myth) of the foundation of the Congress—A. O. Hume under, under the direction and guidance of the Viceroy Lord Dufferin, founded the Congress to channel the emerging unrest and potential mass revolution into a safety valve. Citing this genesis, several intellectuals, extreme right-wing, liberals criticized that the Congress had been compromising and anti-national from the beginning and this played a role in their behavior afterwards.
12. This chapter takes on this myth. It argues that, by citing evidences, Hume, after his retirement from ICS in 1882, had publicly encouraged Indians to take part in politics, to unite and discuss political reforms while Dufferin was critical of the Congress for taking part in political matters and was never supportive of the movement. Dufferin and others were fearful of an Irish-type revolutionary agitation in India.

### Foundation of the Indian National Congress: The Reality

13. The early objectives of the Congress was to induct the people into politics and national feeling. Colonial critics cited the diversity of caste, religion, creed as main challenges toward this goal. The Congress leaders conceded this; nonetheless, declared that India was a nation-in-the-making. They foresaw that this nation building process would take long.
14. To bring diverse people under a national umbrella, the Congress decided their sessions be held by rotation at various cities. The mass politics was new and the people should be introduced to politics. Importance of nation-wide organization and leadership was seen. From the beginning, the Congress was organized as a parliament and the proceedings were democratic. They stood for sovereignty of the people, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, against racial discrimation.
15. The formation of the Congress was the culmination of various unrest and agitations (regarding tariffs, right for Indian judges to try Europeans, etc) in the preceding decades. In its initial stage, the Congress did not organize mass movements. Early nationalists took time to understand the nature of colonial state. Having a distinguished British ex-officer as the organizer worked in their favor for it were an Indian organizing a mass all-India anti-colonial movement, the reaction of the colonial state could have been harsh and quick.

### Socio-Religious Reforms and the National Awakening

16. Raja Rammohan Roy, in 1828, pointed out that the caste system and the divisions in Hinduism is a huge roadblock toward patriotic feeling. A Hindu deals with sacredness everywhere in daily life. Social conditions of women were distressing—birth was unwelcome, marriage was a burden and widowhood was unauspicious.
17. Need for socio-religious reforms. But practices based on faith cannot be directly challenged without bringing faith into question. Therefore, Rammohan demonstrated sati had no religious sanction, Vidyasagar defended widow marriage with scriptural support and Dayanand based his anti-casteism on Vedic authority.
18. The 19th century brought great socio-religious in Indian societies—dispense with old traditions but resisted the colonial hegemony. Intellectuals argued against polygamy and polytheism; many advocated "one religion, one god"; some vouched for no religion.

### An Economic Critique of Colonialism

19. The strongest reason for anti-colonialism was given by the Moderates—the indigenous economy was regressing and imperialism is the culprit. Dadabhai Naoroji, R. C. Dutt and M. G. Ranade were the main proponents of economic nationalism. The need for industrialization using modern technology was felt but it should come from indigenous capital, not foreign capital.
20. Handicrafts industry was falling. But the colonial administrators cited foreign trade and building of railways as signs of economic boost. Early nationalists argued that free trade was ruining indigenous industries—India was serving as provider of raw materials. The economic drain theory had an added advantage that it was easily understood by the peasants.
21. The drain theory revealed the nature of colonial rule. This degraded their moral force (primary school texts had taught about the benefits of British rule). This planted a feeling of mistrust in the benevolence of the colonial power. The demand of self-government was slowly surfacing. At the 1905 Benares Congress session, Dadabhai Naoroji suggested self-government as the only remedy to India's woes.

### The Fight to Secure Press Freedom

22. Early on, nationalists saw the importance of the press. Nearly one-third of the founding members of the Congress were journalists. Newspapers were not business enterprises and were published as public service. Since 1870, Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code had existed, which punished whoever attempted to excite disaffection of the Government—to bypass this, Indian journalists came up with clever strategies such as publishing anti-imperialist excerpts, sometimes without quotes, from London-based socialist or Irish newspapers or other publications drawing parallels with the Indian condition.
23. As newspapers became highly critical of colonial administration, especially Lord Lytton's inhuman response to the victims of famine of 1876-77, the Vernacular Act of 1878, directed at Indian language newspapers, was passed in secrecy in a single sitting of the Imperial Legislative Council, providing confiscation of press if the Government believed it was publishing seditious material. It is mostly aimed at _Amrita Bazar Patrika_ which came out in Bengali and English. Overnight, the editors converted it into an English newspaper! Following public oppositions, the act was repealed in 1881 by Lord Ripon.
24. The chapter then gives a very interesting account of B. G. Tilak's life as an editor and champion of the press. A short mention of Gandhi's imprisonment under the same conditions except that Tilak pleaded not guilty (1908) and Gandhiji openly conceded guilt (1922)—only shows how far the national movement had evolved!

### Propaganda in the Legislatures

25. The Imperial Legistative Council (1861-1947) was formed by adding new members to Governor General's Executive Council—mostly a fraud, almost powerless, could not discuss any budget or bill without the Government's consent, could not discuss the actions of the administration—but it had a few Indian members (mostly zamindars and merchants) to represent the voice of the people. The ILC was hence heavily criticized by the public but the Moderates were rather careful not to push too hard with heavy demands—till 1892, their demand was limited to expansion and reform of Legislative Councils.
26. Due to nationalist agitation, Government amended Indian Councils Act of 1892 changing some functioning of Legislative Councils. Number of members increased and were given the right to discuss budget but could neither vote on it nor move a motion to amend it. They could ask questions but were not allowed to discuss answers. The nationalists saw this as a mockery of their demands. Later, the Legistative Councils became more useful as nationalists P. Mehta and G. K. Gokhale became members.

### The Swadeshi Movement—1903-1908

27. The Swadeshi Movement arose in resistance to Bengal partition, which would benefit the Government as it would divide the population, reduce Bengali speakers to minority among Oriya and Hindi speakers and would create a divide between Hindus and Muslims following a formation of Muslim-majority state with capital at Dacca. Despite huge protests at everywhere, the partition was announced in 1905—the techniques of the Moderates were cleary not working—boycott of foreign products began, zamindars even joined the common people in the movement—on the night of partition, _Vande Mataram_ became the theme song of the movement.
28. Militant nationalists led by Tilak and Lajpat Rai wanted to extend the boycott and Swadeshi to the rest of India and turn it into a full fledged political mass struggle. Moderates were not willing to go that far. In Bengal, Radical Nationalism began—boycott of government schools and colleges, titles, offices and services. Other features (effects) of the Swadeshi movement were self-reliance, love for Indian traditional art, music, literature (think of Tagore), founding of National Council of Education in Bengal, Swadeshi textile mills and factories.
29. The Government consciously used communalism to thwart Swadeshi. In most parts of Bengal, a line of division was drawn between landlords (mostly Hindus) and peasants (mostly Muslims)—All India Muslim League was formed under the guidance of the Government. The rest of India were not very ready to adopt entirely new violent political movements. Besides, Tilak was imprisoned, several leaders were arrested, deported or retired. The Congress also splited into two factions. The Government also took violent action on the participants—physical beating, suspension from offices and schools. The Swadeshi hence could not be sustained.

### The Split in the Congress and the Rise of Revolutionary Nationalism

30. The Government planned to isolate the Radicals from the Moderates; the former can be dealt with force and repression and then the Moderates can be ignored. The Government offered a bait: promised to reform Legislative Councils and asked for cooperation—the Moderates conceded to this, while vigorous movement was taking place in the country.
31. The Radicals wanted to extend the Swadeshi and the Boycott to the nation and include more drastic measures (non-cooperation). The Moderates wanted to restrict the Swadeshi only in Bengal and were against any drastic movements. The split happened in 1907; the Government took immediate actions to wipe out the Radicals—their leader Tilak was imprisoned, several Radicals arrested and some retired. The Moderates also lost support, especially from the youth. After 1908, the national movement as a whole declined. To promote communalism, the Government then gave separate electorates for Muslims (by Indian Councils Act of 1909).
32. The failure of the Congress made way for Revolutionary Nationalism. Young revolutionaries bombed unpopular government officials (once they accidentally killed two English ladies, and the culprits were hanged). Secret societies were formed; an unsucessfull attempt was made at Viceroy Lord Hardinge's life (he was only wounded). Some revolutionary activities followed in England as well.

### World War I and Indian Nationalism: The Ghadar

33. The West Coast of North America had a good size of Indian immigrants and the _Ghadar_, a weekly publication, was circulated to ignite revolutionary and anti-British feeling by uniting all Indians living there. Har Dayal was arrested by the US Government for spreading anarchist literature (although everyone suspected the British had something to do with it) but he escaped and fled to Berlin.
34. When WWI broke out, the revolutionaries saw an opportunity to strike. A large number of immigrant Indians returned for armed revolution. The Government, not ignorant to this, scrutinized the incoming Indians and detained suspicious ones. Back in Punjab, the people would not share the romantic adventures of the Ghadar. Soon, several revolutionaries and leaders were beheaded, hanged or imprisoned.
35. Was then the Ghadar a success or a failure? It helped in the unification of religions and formation of a secular nationalist outlook. It had all the main ingredients of Moderates' critique of colonialism, armed with youth and energy to strike. But it also lacked leadership (Har Dayal was more of a propagandist) and the militants were united by enthusiasm rather than careful organization. They underestimated the strength of the British in India and wrongly assumed that with their actions, the mass of the India would be ignited.

### The Home Rule Movement and Its Fallout

36. When Tilak was released in 1914, he found the movement in a different state of affairs—the Congress had been largely inactive. Initial efforts to merge the Radicals with the Moderates proved to be futile. After the death of P. Mehta (leader of the Bengal group that opposed the Radicals), the Moderates (largely led by Annie Besant) reconciled with the Radicals (Tilak)—then came the Home Rule Leagues, inspired by the Irish example—Tilak's League operated in Maharastra (excluding Bengal) and Karnataka, Besant's operated in the other parts of India. Braches were set up to impart political education and organization.
37. The Lucknow Pact of 1916—an agreement between the Congress and AIML—the Congress agreed to separate electorates for Muslims and one-third seats for the Muslims in the Councils and the Muslim League leaders agreed to join the Congress in demanding Indian autonomy.
38. As Home Rule Leagues garnered momentum, the Government took their action by detaining Besant. This led to more resistance as more Moderates joined the Home Rule Leagues, Tilak advocated the use of passive resistance or civil disobedience and it attracted wider public participation. But Montagu's 1917 declaration that new reforms would be made to induct more Indians in every branch of administration and gradual development of self-governing institutions and Besant's release made the Moderates sit back. Besant herself could not decide whether to strike or wait. Tilak was away for a case in England. The Home Rule Movement was thus left largely leaderless.

### Gandhiji's Early Career and Activism

39. Gandhi's South Africa journey began in 1893 as a British-educated lawyer to fight a case for a merchant. He saw the enormous racism and injustice, and encouraged the immigrant Indians to stand up. His used moderate methods such as to send petitions, organize protests, and meet British officials for reforms. As this proved futile, he launched his _Satyagraha_ and civil disobedience (people eager to plead guilty and go to prison). At length, by way of negotiations, the Government conceded some demands of the Indians.
40. Gandhi returned to India in 1915 but didn't get involved in politics for a few years, preferring to study the situation first. He handled the case of Camparan—indigo goods having failed, the planters decided to terminate the plantation but demanded some taxes in exchange for the peasants' freedom. Gandhi enacted civil disobedience, studied the problem and was able to negotiate to get some refunds. Then Gandhi's efforts to gain increased wages for industrial workers at Ahmedabad and fight against taxes at Kheda district followed.
41. Gandhi realised the Moderate method would not get anywhere but wasn't fond of enacting the Home Rule Movement during the British's vulnerable WWI period. He entered into the national movement during the opposition against the two Rowlatt bills. He launched _Satyagraha_ but things escalated too quickly in Punjab as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place.

### The Non-Cooperation Movement—1920-1922

42. Khilafat Movement began against the dismemberment of the Ottaman Empire following the end of WWI—merged with Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement—was noted for promoting Hindu-Muslim unity. The Swadeshi and the boycott were revived. The _khadi_ became a uniform of the national movement. Mohammed Ali declared, in Karachi 1921, that it's religiously unlawful for Muslims to continue in the British Army. The visit of the Prince of Wales was a dramatic event—it led to violence against Christians and British-loyalists with some death toll—peace was restored only after Gandhi fasted for three days.
43. The Non-Cooperation Movement was dealt with further repression. Several leaders and some 30,000 people were arrested and soon, Gandhi was the only top leader who remained out of jail. He sent a letter to Viceroy Lord Reading asking to lift the ban on civil liberties and release of political prisoners. With no other choice left, Gandhi announced the civil disobedience movement to be enacted at Surat and asked the rest of the nation to cooperate and remain quiet. However, at Chauri Chaura, some action of the police angered a crowd leading to a mass quarrel between the parties with some death toll. Gandhi was disappointed and called off the Non-Cooperation Movement.
44. Gandhi's calling off of Non-Cooperation following the Chuari Chaura event attracted questions and criticisms. This chapter discusses those criticisms—fear of radicals going out of hand and taking over, Gandhi's effort to protect zamindars and landlords, etc.—the authors argue that, in hindsight, Gandhi probably made the right choice: the Chauri Chaura incident gave the Government a reason to justify their potential repression even before the civil disobedience commenced, the people were regressing to the old life after a year-long movement and it was probably time to recuperate.

### Peasant Movements and Nationalism in the 1920s

45. This chapter outlines some peasant movements: Kisan Shaba movements in UP, Mappila rebellion in Malabar (Muslim agitation in conjunction with Khilafat movement) and Valabhbhai-led Bardoli _Satyagraha_ for tax registance in Gujarat.

### The Indian Working Class and the National Movement

46. Working class movements were sporadic and un-organized in the 19th century. A good amount of them occured in the places with foreign capital—the government press, railways or jute mills. In 1920, All India Trade Union Congress was founded and more organized worker strikes followed. Soon these strikes became entangled with national movement as workers realized that _swaraj_ would make their goals achievable.
47. In the second half of 1920s, there was a growing influence of communication and left trend within the Congress and the workers. In 1927, AITUC decided to boycott the Simon Commission. This was met with repressive laws and arrest of the leaders by the government. In the following years, the communist wing got isolated from the national movement and by 1931, they were thrown out of AITUC in a split. A dip in working class activities followed in the coming years.
48. Once again the communists rejoined the national movement. The Communists, the Congress Socialists and the Left nationalists led by Nehru and Bose had a big influence within the Congress and elsewhere. After the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the Communists then dissociated from the Quit India Movement led by Gandhi, in support of the Allied forces to defeat fascism.

### The Struggles for Gurdwara Reform and Temple Entry

49. The priests of Gurdwara went corrupt as they took in the offerings for personal again, and then began to live a life of luxury. The government supported them, installed institutions to preach loyalty to Sikhism and used them to keep the people away from nationalist ideas. A shock came when the priests declared the Ghadarites as renegades and honoired General Dyer declaring him to be a Sikh.
50. This led to the Akali Movement, with an aim to liberate the Gurdwaras and pass the control to local devotees. The movement enacted _Satyagraha_ and it got serious. It got integrated with the national movement as the Akalis began to think of India as the bigger Gurdwara. One of the achievements of the movement was to make the peasants and common people politically conscious and bring Sikh devotees under the national movement radar.
51. Post-1920s, the nationalist leaders began to take acute steps to rid casteism. In Kerala, Harijans enacted _Satyagraha_ to fight for right to enter temples. Gandhi, during his Kerala tour, supported this movement and didn't visit a single temple that did not permit Harijans. The temple entry movement was resisted by caste Hindus. Although the movement wasn't entirely successful, it was nevertheless a massive step toward dispensing untouchability and casteism throughout the country.

### The Years of Stagnation—Swarajists, No-changers and Gandhiji

52. Following the end of the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1922, Gandhi was arrested. People were demoralized and some began to question Gandhi's methods. The Swaraj Party, led by C. R. Das and Motilal, split from the Congress—with a goal to enter into Legislative Councils and put forth swaraj ideas and if rejected, to make a constant attempt to thwart Council activities so that the government realizes it's impossible for the Councils to run.
53. Those who opposed this idea—known as no-changers—wanted to continue the boycott and warned that indulgence in Council activities might lead to manipulation by and integration to the government.
54. Gandhi was released on health grounds and though, he was against the idea of the  Swaraj party, he avoided commenting publicly. A split in the Congress would be highly unproductive. The Swaraj party had some success in their early days in the Councils. They filled the political void following the end of Non-Cooperation Movement while the nation was recouping its strength.

### Bhagat Singh, Surya Sen and the Revolutionary Nationalism

55. When other methods proved futile, revolutionary nationalism would take place. Hindustan Republican Association (or Army), founded in 1924, had a goal to unite Indian states into a Federal Republic. After the Kakori robbery—which led to hanging and deportation—the revolutionaries were once again re-organized, led by Chandrashekhar Azad, into Hindustan Socialist Republican Association putting socialism as a goal.
56. Lala Lajput's death in an anti-Simon Commission demonstration led to assassination of concerned officer by HSRA. Later, in 1929, Bhagat and B. K. Dutt safe-bombed the Central Legislative Assembly against the passage of the Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Bill which would severely limit civil liberties. The idea was to get caught and tried, and use the court to reach the people. Everyday they would enter the court shouting nationalist slogans and this earned them a hugh support from all over the nation. However, Bhagat, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged in 1931.
57. An organized revolutionary activity was seen in Chittagong, led by Surya Sen, as they seized ammunition, disrupted telephone, telegraph and railways, proclaimed a Provisional Revolutionary Goverment by hoisting the national flag, singing slogans and wearing dhoti. They dispersed into the Chittagong hill and engaged in an arm-fight with the surrounding army. Although they were still in hunt, Surya Sen and his colleagues survived for 3 years as they got support from the villages untill they were finally caught, tried and hanged. As opposed to Bhagat's individual heroism and the ones before, this was an organized mass revolutionary activity—Muslims and Hindus joined, women and students took up arms and assassinated officials.

### The Gathering Storm—1927-1929

58. The Simon Commission, 1927, was met with a huge mass protest. Wherever Simon and his company went, they were greeted with black flags, rallies, slogans and ridiculed urging him to go back. This led to a new age of youth agitation and participation in politics (e.g., Nehru, Bose emerged as leaders, inspired by socialism). The Nehru Report of 1928 pushed for a dominion status of India along with other demands as their primary goal. This was in response to Lord Birkenhead's constant harp that Indians could not arrive at a common goal of constitutional reforms.
59. The report had its oppositions. Jinnah, in his Fourteen Points, demanded separate Muslim electorates which were in Lucknow pact but rejected by the report. Likewise, Jawaharlal and Bose had different ideas—complete independence. It was decided, on Gandhi's proposal, that if the Government failed to give dominion status within a year, they would adopt complete independence as their goal and enact civil disobedience movement to achieve that goal.
60. As Lord Irwin himself told Gandhi that dominion status cannot be achieved, the Congress, in its 1929 Lahore annual sessions, resolved to enact civil disobedience to attain Purna Swaraj. This led to the emergence of Nehru as a national leader (some older nationalists had their doubts but Gandhi believed in him). On 1930 Jan 26, the national flag was hoisted and the declaration of Purna Swaraj. The resolution was to enact non-violent civil disobedience including non-payment of taxes.

### Civil Disobedience—1930-1931

61. After writing to Irwin about his plans, Gandhi and members of his Sabarmati Ashram began their historic Dandi March from Ahmedabad, joined by thousands, walking all the way to the Dandi coast where he broke the law by picking up salt, and then he inaugurated the Civil Disobedience Movement. Breaking of salt law followed elsewhere, with non-payment of taxes and various civil disobedience activities. Defiance of forest laws by tribes and no-rent movements were seen in some places.
62. The colonial government found themselves in a perplexing situation. If they allowed the movement to continue, they would be seen as weak but if they used repression, they would be seen as brutal to use violence on a non-violent movement. Either way, it's a blow to their prestige. Slowly they suspended civil liberties and later the Congress was declared unlawful. There was no mention of dominion status in the Simon Commission report.
63. The Gandhi-Irwin pact—seen as a disgrace to the colonial government as it seemed to be a truce between two parties in the equal footing—granted the release of political prisoners not convicted of violence, remission of fine not collected, return of lands not sold to third parties, lenient treatment of employees who had resigned, right to make salt for consumption and the end of civil disobedience movement. Gandhi was criticised for the non-commutation of death sentences of Bhagat and his comrades (despite him having tried).

### From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-1934

64. The Karachi session resolved the fundamental rights and the national economic programming. The Gandhi-Irwin pact was hated by the British because it conveyed the notion that the Congress and the colonial government were on an equal footing as to sign a truce. Irwin was replaced by Willingdon as Viceroy. Their new policy was to make sure Gandhi could never again garner mass movement as he did before and to prevent mass uprisings. Gandhi asked Willingdon for a meeting but was declined. Then the government enacted various repressive measures, arrested Gandhi and enacted Civil Martial Law leading to suspension of all civil liberties. Within a week, all top leaders of the Congress were in jail.
65. The colonial government constantly played the game of divide and rule. For instance, they introduced the Communal Award giving separate electorates for Muslims, Sikhs and Christians, and now for Depressed Classes (Harijans and Scheduled Castes). This led to much criticisms and debates, and ultimately to the Poona Pact where the idea of separate electorates were abandoned but the number of reserved seats in Legislative Councils were increased.
66. Gandhi began his Harijan tour from Wardha in 1933 traversing various villages in India for nearly 9 months propagating to eradicate untouchability in all forms and practices. Throughout the tour, he was attacked by orthodox Hindu devotees. He was accused of attacking Hinduism. In reaction, Gandhi explained his campaign on the grounds of humanity and reason, and that untouchability has no sanction in Hindu Shastras either. Gandhi was of the idea that caste Hindus must repay for what Harijans suffered—explains why Indians born and brought up before 1947 are lenient toward reservation?

### The Rise of the Left-Wing
