### The First Major Challenge: The Revolt of 1857

1. The sepoys were displeased with the East India Company for various reasons—threat to their religion and caste system (including loss of caste system beyond the sea), rumor of incoming Christian conversion, low salary, racism in job promotion, farmer families impoverished due to revenue system. Before the great revolt (sieze of Delhi) of 1857, some revolts occured (e.g. Mangal Pandey).
2. Sepoys from Meerut marched to Red Fort and compelled Bahadur Shah II to take command (as emperor of Hindustan). Several revolts followed at many places, particularly North India. Many former rulers were not enthusiastic to join the rebels but were forced to join. Only the sepoys of Madras were fully loyal to the East India Company.
3. The civil population were also affected by the Company's policies—farmers lost their land due to heavy taxes, artisans and handicraftsman lost their jobs when the Company imported and encouraged British goods. The revolt of sepoys inspired their large-scale participation. But the entire revolt appears to have been instantaneous without any firm plan or vision of the future.
4. Due to the Doctrine of Lapse, Rani Lakshmibhai of Jhansi could not pass down the heir to her adopted son. She later openly joined the rebels. Barring her and a few leaders, most other leaders were without will. Some kept switching sides according to which side had the upper hand. Bahadur Shah II himself asked the Company for his safety. The revolt was ultimately unsucessful.

### Civil Rebellions and Tribal Uprisings

5. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 wasn't the first of rebellions. There had been revolts in various places since the Battle of Plassey—they were localized and isolated.
6. Major cause of the rebellions appears to have been the quick changes the Company brought in economy, administration and land revenue system. No tariffs on British imported goods but tariffs on Indian exports, increased land revenue (compared to Mughal times).
7. Tribal groups depended on forests for survival (one major way of life was shifting cultivation). The Company introduced heavy land revenue, taxes on forest products, banned shifting cultivation, restricted tribal access to forests leading to mass unemployment and impoverishment. Hence the tribal rebellions.

### Peasant Movements and Uprisings after 1857

8. Indigo Revolt of 1859-1860 in Bengal: Peasants were forced to grow indigo by being paid a low advance; the conditions were oppressive; they rebelled by not growing indigo anymore and retaliating the lathiyals sent by the planters. Peasants attacked factories and resisted police attacks. The revolt was large-scaled with unity between Hindus and Muslims—leading to success as planters closed down factories and indigo cultivation stopped.
9. Agrarian unrest in 1870s and early 1880s in Bengal: Agrarian leagues were formed in retaliation to zamindars' increased rents. The government defended zamindars whenever violence took place, otherwise maintained neutrality. Reconciliation came easy as the leagues were only against zamindars, displayed no anti-colonial sentiments and only acted within the law. Some protections came in the form of Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885.
10. Deccan peasants' boycott of moneylenders (who were mostly outsiders: Marwaris and Gujaratis) in some districts of Maharastra in the 1870s. Since there were no anti-colonial sentiments and the demands were reasonable, success came easy. Once the debt bonds were surrendered, no more violence was needed.

### Foundation of the Congress: The Myth

11. The safety-valve theory (or myth) of the foundation of the Congress—A. O. Hume under, under the direction and guidance of the Viceroy Lord Dufferin, founded the Congress to channel the emerging unrest and potential mass revolution into a safety valve. Citing this genesis, several intellectuals, extreme right-wing, liberals criticized that the Congress had been compromising and anti-national from the beginning and this played a role in their behavior afterwards.
12. This chapter takes on this myth. It argues that, by citing evidences, Hume, after his retirement from ICS in 1882, had publicly encouraged Indians to take part in politics, to unite and discuss political reforms while Dufferin was critical of the Congress for taking part in political matters and was never supportive of the movement. Dufferin and others were fearful of an Irish-type revolutionary agitation in India.

### Foundation of the Indian National Congress: The Reality

13. The early objectives of the Congress was to induct the people into politics and national feeling. Colonial critics cited the diversity of caste, religion, creed as main challenges toward this goal. The Congress leaders conceded this; nonetheless, declared that India was a nation-in-the-making. They foresaw that this nation building process would take long.
14. To bring diverse people under a national umbrella, the Congress decided their sessions be held by rotation at various cities. The mass politics was new and the people should be introduced to politics. Importance of nation-wide organization and leadership was seen. From the beginning, the Congress was organized as a parliament and the proceedings were democratic. They stood for sovereignty of the people, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, against racial discrimation.
15. The formation of the Congress was the culmination of various unrest and agitations (regarding tariffs, right for Indian judges to try Europeans, etc) in the preceding decades. In its initial stage, the Congress did not organize mass movements. Early nationalists took time to understand the nature of colonial state. Having a distinguished British ex-officer as the organizer worked in their favor for it were an Indian organizing a mass all-India anti-colonial movement, the reaction of the colonial state could have been harsh and quick.

### Socio-Religious Reforms and the National Awakening

16. Raja Rammohan Roy, in 1828, pointed out that the caste system and the divisions in Hinduism is a huge roadblock toward patriotic feeling. A Hindu deals with sacredness everywhere in daily life. Social conditions of women were distressing—birth was unwelcome, marriage was a burden and widowhood was unauspicious.
17. Need for socio-religious reforms. But practices based on faith cannot be directly challenged without bringing faith into question. Therefore, Rammohan demonstrated sati had no religious sanction, Vidyasagar defended widow marriage with scriptural support and Dayanand based his anti-casteism on Vedic authority.
18. The 19th century brought great socio-religious in Indian societies—dispense with old traditions but resisted the colonial hegemony. Intellectuals argued against polygamy and polytheism; many advocated "one religion, one god"; some vouched for no religion.

### An Economic Critique of Colonialism

19. The strongest reason for anti-colonialism was given by the Moderates—the indigenous economy was regressing and imperialism is the culprit. Dadabhai Naoroji, R. C. Dutt and M. G. Ranade were the main proponents of economic nationalism. The need for industrialization using modern technology was felt but it should come from indigenous capital, not foreign capital.
20. Handicrafts industry was falling. But the colonial administrators cited foreign trade and building of railways as signs of economic boost. Early nationalists argued that free trade was ruining indigenous industries—India was serving as provider of raw materials. The economic drain theory had an added advantage that it was easily understood by the peasants.
21. The drain theory revealed the nature of colonial rule. This degraded their moral force (primary school texts had taught about the benefits of British rule). This planted a feeling of mistrust in the benevolence of the colonial power. The demand of self-government was slowly surfacing. At the 1905 Benares Congress session, Dadabhai Naoroji suggested self-government as the only remedy to India's woes.

### The Fight to Secure Press Freedom

22. Early on, nationalists saw the importance of the press. Nearly one-third of the founding members of the Congress were journalists. Newspapers were not business enterprises and were published as public service. Since 1870, Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code had existed, which punished whoever attempted to excite disaffection of the Government—to bypass this, Indian journalists came up with clever strategies such as publishing anti-imperialist excerpts, sometimes without quotes, from London-based socialist or Irish newspapers or other publications drawing parallels with the Indian condition.
23. As newspapers became highly critical of colonial administration, especially Lord Lytton's inhuman response to the victims of famine of 1876-77, the Vernacular Act of 1878, directed at Indian language newspapers, was passed in secrecy in a single sitting of the Imperial Legislative Council, providing confiscation of press if the Government believed it was publishing seditious material. It is mostly aimed at _Amrita Bazar Patrika_ which came out in Bengali and English. Overnight, the editors converted it into an English newspaper! Following public oppositions, the act was repealed in 1881 by Lord Ripon.
24. The chapter then gives a very interesting account of B. G. Tilak's life as an editor and champion of the press. A short mention of Gandhi's imprisonment under the same conditions except that Tilak pleaded not guilty (1908) and Gandhiji openly conceded guilt (1922)—only shows how far the national movement had evolved!
