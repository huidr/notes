### The First Major Challenge: The Revolt of 1857

1. The sepoys were displeased with the East India Company for various reasons—threat to their religion and caste system (including loss of caste system beyond the sea) , rumor of incoming Christian conversion, low salary, racism in job promotion, farmer families impoverished due to revenue system. Before the great revolt (sieze of Delhi) of 1857, some revolts occured (e.g. Mangal Pandey).
2. Sepoys from Meerut marched to Red Fort and compelled Bahadur Shah II to take command (as emperor of Hindustan). Several revolts followed at many places, particularly North India. Many former rulers were not enthusiastic to join the rebels but were forced to join. Only the sepoys of Madras were fully loyal to the East India Company.
3. The civil population were also affected by the Company's policies—farmers lost their land due to heavy taxes, artisans and handicraftsman lost their jobs when the Company imported and encouraged British goods. The revolt of sepoys inspired their large-scale participation. But the entire revolt appears to have been instantaneous without any firm plan or vision of the future.
4. Due to the Doctrine of Lapse, Rani Lakshmibhai of Jhansi could not pass down the heir to her adopted son. She later openly joined the rebels. Barring her and a few leaders, most other leaders were without will. Some kept switching sides according to which side had the upper hand. Bahadur Shah II himself asked the Company for his safety. The revolt was ultimately unsucessful.
