### Introductory: The Land and People

1. Manipur's size changed according to monarch's power—present size almost fixed since controversial transfer of Kabaw Valley to Burma in 1834
2. Geography: mountainous green—all rivers flow north to south except Leimatak—tracks through mountain ranges for trade and migration of Indo-Mongoloid, Negrito and Dravidian and Caucasoids—lakes greatly reduced during 19th and 20th cen
3. Tibeto-Burmans, Indo-Aryans, sizeable section of Tai (Shans) came to Manipur from pre-historic times to present day—migrating people brought Stone Age—metal usage learned through trade with Upper Burma and Thailand
4. Trade with Yunan province of China—Manipur in constant contact with Indian, Tai and Chinese through trade—learned silk, silk worm rearing, brick making and gun power making from the Chinese
5. Several theories about Meitei origins—are not (descendants of) Aryans, but some Aryan elements among them—archaeological findings at Tharon cave points to existence of Mon-Khmer speaking Austroloid Mongoloid people who migrated here before the advent of Tibeto-Burman speakers; these Mon-Khmer elements absorbed by later immigrants—absorption of many Tai immigrants into Meitei society since 8th-cen AD
6. (T. C. Hodson) Meitei people alike Naga-Kuki of the hills—foreign invasions, Shan, Burmese, English and Hindu left a permanent mark, leading to Meitei civilization away from primitiveness
7. Meitei descendants of hill people?—same language family: Tibeto-Burman—close connection of Meitei clans with hill people in close vicinity—similarity of royal Meitei costumes with Naga tribes—similarity of architecture of Kangla halls with ritual houses of Naga tribes—Angom chronicles indicates Angom were in Ukhrul at some point of their migration—tradition of Meitei (Mangang) settlement in Koubru before moving into the valley
8. Naga: umbrella term for many tribes who all speak Tibeto-Burman—some Kuki tribes migrated to Manipur hills in pre-historic times along with or after the Meitei advent in the valley—more Kukis came 18th-cen onwards due to the great Kuki exodus—Pangals settled in Manipur since 17th-cen, adopted Meitei language—many Indian communities migrated at the end of 19th-cen: Bihari, Bengalis, Marwaris, Nepalis

### Sources of history

9. R. B. Pemberton (a young British officer)—volunteered to join guerilla force of Gambhir Singh in liberation movement to drive away the Burmese—later, represented Manipur as a commissioner in Kabaw Valley dispute with Burma—a pioneer of modern historical researches in Manipur—rejected Hindu origin of Meiteis
10. T. C. Hodson—his _Meitheis_ is still the best full scale study of Meiteis
11. P. Parijat (local writer)—wrote _Manipur Purabritta_, giving genealogy of rulers with chronology—proposed that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba might have ruled in 4th-cen AD and not from 33 AD
12. _Cheitharol Kumbaba_—royal chronicle, has three phases: from Pakhangba to 1484 AD (Kyamba's reign), from 1484 AD to 1780 AD (Bhagyachandra's reign), from 1780 AD to mid-20th-cen (Bodh Chandra's reign)—chronicle keeping began from 1484 during Kyamba's reign, hence first phase dealing with pre-Kyamba rulers is extremely sketchy but second phase is very detailed, reliable—chronicle was lost during multiple Burmese invasions during late 18th-cen, new chronicle re-written under Bhagyachandra's order—the chronicle possibly has some biased views glorifying Meitei conquests—some history possibly excluded since the work was written under heavy eyes of the rulers?
13. Other chronicles exist—_Ningthourol Lambuba_, more detailed than _Cheitharol Kumbaba_ but has no chronology—individual clans also have own chronicles

### Prehistory and Proto-history

14. Evidence of Old Stone Age confined to the hills, but New Stone Age relics all over hills and valley—Manipur appears to have received Brone Age culture from Thailand and upper Burma—evidence of pleistocene men in Manipur dating back to about 30,000 BC
15. Tharon caves findings indicate Hoabinhian culture (of Southeast Asia, Vietnam), possibly of Proto-Austroloids occupying these caves before the advent of Tibeto-Burman speakers, proposed date 5000-4000 BC—
16. Napachik (hillock near a Meitei village at Wangoo) archaeological findings—materials dated 1450 BC found—modern pottery found, which has affinity with those of Neolithic culture of China—edge ground tools found, have affinity with those of caves of Thailand, Burma, Hoabinhian sites in Vietnam—tripod wares found, they are characteristic of Chinese neolithic culture
17. Likely sequence of events as per Napachik findings: while a culture (Austroloid) having affinity to Hoabinhian continued, a full neolithic culture (Tibeto-Burman?) equipped with more advanced tools having affinity to Chinese neolithic culture arrived at Napachik around 2000-1000 BC—Tibeto-Burman Mongoloid settled around 1000 BC
18. Myths abound concerning Meitei origins and early days—Atiya Sidaba, Leimarel Sidabi, Kuptreng (Sanamahi), Sentreng (Pakhangba) and many stories, versions surrounding them—King kangba; first recorded king (some sources say: Tangja Leela Pakhangba)—burial of the dead during King Tonkonba—continuation of long reign, then big flood in the valley, political vacuum till the emergence of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba

### Pakhangba and Foundation of Ningthouja Dynasty

19. Salai literally means ancestor-god of lineage (sa = sagei = lineage, lai = god)—clans were ethnic groups with own language/dialect and culture, occupying a territory
20. Geographical distribution of clans—Luwang, capital at Koubru foothills and later at Lammangdong—Khuman (who lived together with Luwang), separated, went southeast, capital originally at Thoubal, later shifted to Meikoipung (near Mayang Imphal)—Angom, migrated from Ukhrul, later supported Pakhangba to be the ruler of Kangla—Khaba, once very powerful, ruled Kangla before Pakhangba (whom they defeated), later defeated by Pakhangba ascending the throne, then were reduced to a mere social group and merged with Nganbas to form Kha-Nganba—Heiren Khunjam, village level politics, existence and struggle against Meitei kings several centuries after Pakhangba, orginally inhabitated south of Kakching, east of Moirang; later absorbed into different Salais—Sarang-Leisangthem (Chengleis), old ethnic groups, their earliest chiefs also ruled from Kangla at some point
21. Flood due to landslides caused by change of course of Leimatak?—valley people rushed to hills, some Angom became (merged with) Tangkhul?—when dried, people came down to the valley but no organised state at Kangla—political vacuum and anarchy; many ethnic groups struggled, sponsored candidates for throne of Kangla—Nongda Lairen Pakhangba emerged successful—mysteries and theories of Pakhangba's birth and origins
22. Legends concerning Poireiton—on a mission to colonise valley—traveled through Shans in Kabaw valley, tribes of Tengnoupal hills, then entered valley—contemporary of Pakhangba? rebelled against him for throne?
23. Pakhangba, who was supported by Puleiromba (chief of Angom), Luwang, Chakpas and other tribes, ascended the throne—later absorbed Moirang, Khuman and many other tribes into Meitei—seven clan system began, many developments followed, also imposed marriage rules?—departments created: Laipham Shanglen (court of justice), Naharup Shanglen, etc—horse hockey, umanglais (ancestors of villages) worshipped, Sahamahi-Pakhangba worship not started yet?—mysteries surrounding Pakhangba's death, but possibly killed by Khabas
24. Settlements of migrants during Pakhangba's time—led by different leaders: Poireiton, Arong, Thongaren; settled at different places—Thongaren's group became Naharup—Poireiton's group became Ahallup? Poireiton as progenitor of Luwang clan (W. Yumjao Singh)
25. Chronology of Pakhangba—reign started form 33 AD (_Kumbaba_), 374 AD (P. Parijat), 789 AD (pandits during Bhagyachandra's reign)—reign of over 100 years myth, reign of 12 years (according to Angom Gopi's _Pakhangba Nongkarol_, written during Pamheiba's reign)

### Evolution of the Meitei State

26. Khuiyoi Tompok (Pakhangba's son)—invention of drums, technical innovation in metallurgy
27. Taothingmang (Tompok's younger son)—dredging of Imphal and Iril rivers, helped by his brother Yoimongba—conquered Lokkha-Haokha (near Sugnu), first contact between the Ningthouja and hillmen recorded in _Kumbaba_—more kings came...
28. Naophangba—a religious leader from Bengal influenced him (the king) to adopt Hinduism?—stopped burial of the dead, introduced cremation, declared meat consumption taboo—but ultimately, king rejected the new religion?
29. Naothingkhong, runaway prince who came back to ascend the throne (under his mother's pleas) after a political anarchy of 5 years—poorly equipped, surrendered to Shamlung (invader from Pong) who, unlike other Burmese conquerers, did not commit any atrocities in Manipur, rather lifted the society, introduced change in clothing and food habits (women were completely naked before?)
30. Phayeng copper plate of King Khongtekcha—oldest Meitei script written inscribed inscription? deals with worship of Shiva and Devi by Khongtekcha—preachers of Hinduism must have been arriving in Manipur from time to time—mention of "Hari" implying worship of Vishnu—the authenticity of the finding doubtful, language adopted not as archaic as to be of 8th-cen AD—royalty did not embrace Vaishnavism before 18th-cen, but worship of Vishnu by Brahmin immigrants possibly existed in 15th-cen or before
31. By 12th-cen AD, Meitei state had handicrafts, weaving, maibas (shamans), artisans—continued to have conflict with Khuman (over encroachments of territory during hunting?) , Moirang, raided small tribes—Shans invaded, defeated Khumans; Meitei king Khumomba (1263-78) defeated Shans on the bank of Ikop lake, first victory against foreign invasion?
32. Ningthou Khomba (1432-67)—tricked Shans of Tamu, gained their support in his invasion of Moirang (first major defeat of Moirang), but Moirang continued to stay autonomous—his queen Linthoingambi outwitted the Tangkhuls who invaded Meitei in Khomba's absence, she raided/invaded and conquered several other tribes?—Kabaw Shans settled in valley, married Manipuri women, absorbed in Meitei society—Meitei, feudal system, almost a complete state except for Moirang's autonomy

### Regional Principalities

33. Seven-clan system not yet established during Pakhangba's time, possibly many clans, groups, tribes—Khabas, who ruled at Kangla before Pakhangba, had been defeated—Pakhangba gained the support of Luwang, Angom—Chengleis, Heiren Khunjan, Chakpa, Mangang had village level chiefdoms, foreign-sponsored Bangal (Mayang?) principality at Lammangdong?
34. Khabas rebelled (attacked) against Pakhangba, who fled to Moirang; Khaba (oppressively) ruled Kangla again for some time, the people were unhappy—Pakhangba, with Moirang's help, drove out Khabas who fled to hills (scattered all over) and became hillmen, regained throne—Pakhangba and wife Laisna lived in constant fear of Khaba rebels; later when Pakhangba was killed by Khabas, Laisna fled and lived among Shelloi Langmais—Khaba could not capture political power, were later blended into a single clan Kha-Nganba after Naothingkhong's reign?
35. Luwang (Poirei village?) supposedly founded by Poireiton who settled down with Luwangs after his colonizing adventure?—splitted into Luwang proper and Khumans—Luwang are peaceful group, supported Pakhangba, maintained good relations with Ningthouja dynasty (despite some conflicts?), deplomacy enabled them to maintain autonomy—Luwang Punshiba, compemporary of Meitei king Ura Konthouba (Naothingkhong's father), introduced boat making?, boat races, horse training, new learning period, scholarship
36. Angom: a common name for several tribes, migrated from the Ukrhul hills—Puleiromba (chief, progenitor of Angom?) supported Pakhangba for the throne—matrimonial relations with Ningthouja dynasty, feeding brides and queens—occasional conflicts with Meitei and other tribes occured
37. Khumans splitted two generations after Poireiton (depicted as progenitor of both Luwang and Khuman), came to known as Khumans after they moved to the east of Loktak?—had matrimonial alliance with Ningthouja, but numerous conflicts too, mostly defeats—later absorbed into Meitei, ceased to have political power but remained a clan
38. Heirem-Khunjans, once very powerful ethnic group, maintaned autonomy for a long time—settled around Kakching, had conflicts with Khuman, Meitei and Moirang—at one point, Khuman needed Ningthouja's assistance to subdue Heirem-Khanjans?—later absorbed into Meitei
39. Moirang (founded by Thangjing Koirel Lai?)—origins: Ngangoi, Kege and Moirang were different principalities, ethnic groups; Keges ruled first? attacked but defeated by Meitei (Khongtekcha); Moirangs (Tibeto-Burman speakers from upper Burma?) later came down from hlls, merged with Keges who were scattered and chief-less?—powerful and great geographic extent, had conficts with Meitei, Khuman, Burmese and other tribes—Sanahongba (Moirang king) was defeated by Meitei in 1432 AD (the end of independence)—after 1432 AD, no king for Moirang for 24 years, Ningthou Khomba sent his younger brother to be king of Moirang but failed due to resistance from Moirang people—absorbed into Meitei (completing Manipur state?) but maintained cultural identity, still continued to have their own kings—Khellei Nungnang Telheiba (1743-67), Moirang king, revolted against Manipur king, had capital at Kwakta, taking advantage of Burmese invasion and with their help, he became Manipur king

### Expansion of the Kingdom of Manipur: Kyamba to Paikhomba

40. Kyamba (Khomba and Linthoingambi's son) ascended throne in 1467 AD at age 24—original name: Thangwai Ningthouba, renamed "Kyamba" after conquering Kyang—reorganised Pana system, began chronicle keeping, introduced cheithaba (foundation of Meitei calendar), cheiraoba
41. Kyamba's conquest of Kabaw Valley—Shans of upper Burma were known to Meiteis as Pongs; Shans of Chindwin basin as Kabaws—Kyamba invited by Pong king for military expedition in Chindwin basin, to meet when Khongan Melei bloomed (orchid flowered one month earlier in Pong), nevertheless joint forces invaded Shans of Chindwin basin in 1470 AD (Kyamba, 27 yr), conquered Kyang and other several principalities, major portion of Kabaw Valley annexed to Manipur—Kyamba and Pong king, treaty of friendship, then fixed the boundary between Manipur and Pong, first foreign treaty recorded in chronicles, Manipur a full fledged sovereign
42. First invasion of Manipur by Mayangs (Thongnang) in 1504 AD as recorded by chronicles, possibly Koches? other invasions followed—Mayangs (earliest settlers from Bengal) had settled at Lammangdong, were defeated by prince Nongthomba (Kyamba's son)
43. Kyamba's reign saw surge in Brahmin immigration and Vishnu worship—Brahmins employed to look after Hindu temples, astrologers; non-Brahmin Hindu migrants were the Lairikyengbams empolyed as royal scribes; ancestors of Meitei Brahmins came during Kyamba's time; more Shans absorbed—legend of Pong king giving a Vishnu statue to Kyamba—Kyamba built a Vishnu temple at Lamangdong? the architecture similar to Burmese pagoda style
44. Mungyamba (after some weak post-Kyamba rulers who lost control over Kabaw Valley?) conquered some principalities in Kabaw Valley, consolidated western, south-eastern and southern hills—boat race became annual festive, granaries established, Ametpa Loishang (medical department) established—gave his son Khagemba proper training in warfare, statecraft, religion, diplomacy and use of Arambai (weapon)
45. Khagemba (1597-1652) ascended throne at age 24, fully matured and trained, original name: Sana Hihouhan Poirei Ningthouhanba—conquered Chinese (Khagi), hence known as Khegemba (Khagi + Ngamba), maintained political control over Kabaw Valley, defended Manipur from Burmese invasions and Kachari-Muslim invasion, defeated Tripuris—control over hill tribes and most tribes of valley; Moirang ceased to be autonomous principality; no Meitei king made as big a military conquest; biggest political and geographic extent yet
46. Kachari-Muslim invasion 1606 AD—dispute over boat among Khagemba's brothers; Sanongba fled with mother and other nobles to Cachar, asked Kachari king to invade Manipur—Kachari sent forces; Meitei forces initally defeated, Khagemba summoned all his nobles, subdued the invasion—Kachari and Muslim forces invaded again but were defeated; Sanongba was captured (later forgiven by Khagemba), other invaders taken prisoners—influence of Muslim civilization under Mughal was felt; Muslim peasant-prisoners settled, absorbed into Meitei
47. Khagemba's reign—liberal social policies; more Brahmin families arrived, Kachari-Muslim captives married local women, given liberty to practice their relgion—changes in etiquette, king now referred to as "Lainingthou", prostration in court-introduction (improvement) of Dolai, capital city divided into four quarters for better administration: Yaiskul (under Yaiskullakpa), Khwai (under Khwairakpa), Khurai (under Khurailakpa), Wangkhei (Wangkheilakpa); Sanongba was given Khurailakpa—more Loisangs (depts) established, Kei (granaries) improved, Taothabi (red and tailed paddy) new crop introduced?, ten markets established, bell metal currency introduced—foreign trade improved, learned brick making and gun powder making from Chinese—contact with Muslims introduced tobacco and pipe smoking, though tobacco was already known in Manipur—Pana Sagol Kangjei introduced, women in sports—Meitei literature reached new highs; reading introduced—secularism: Brahmins, Muslims; Khagemba was deeply religious, follows Sanamahi cult
48. Two more kings: Khunjaoba and Paikhomba—tiger menace in forests, keisumsang introduced, occasional gladiatorial fights between men and animals at market places—foreign trade continued, mostly elephants (elephant stable at Samurou)

### The Zenith and the Decline: 1697-1826

Wave of Hinduism (migration of Brahmins to hill states) during Aurangzeb's final days, who prosecuted Hindus, powerful Ahoms converted to Shakta Hinduism—Charairongba's (Paikhomba's nephew) reign, relative peace, minor raids on hill villages, established friendships with hill chiefs—Brahmins well accpeted in courts and society, Charairongba first Meitei king converted to Hindu (adopted Sanskrit name: Pitambar Singh), embraced Vaishnavism—employed Burmese to build Meitei Kyoungs (Burmese word for temple) and Hindu temples, influence of Burmese architecture—Chairairongba hit by lightning; speared to death (his son played a role?) 
50. Pamheiba: origins—born to Nungthil Chaibi (Sapam family) and Charairongba—Nungthil Chaibi died before Charairongba became king; Pamheiba was kept in Makeng Thangal (a distant village) by his mother and maternal grandfather; rediscovered and brought back to palace by Charairongba after his ascension—ascended in 1709 AD, referred to as Mayamba in _Kumbaba_, given the name "Garibaniwaza" (Persian, meaning "kind to the poor") by Muslims, sometimes referred to as "Mekleswar" or "Manipureshwar
51. Pamheiba: early days—raided hill villages, maintained good control and relations with them, renamed village chief as "Khullakpa"; these allies later aided him in his conquests of Burmese and Tripuris—use of arambai and ponies as major weapon in his battles, known as Cassay horses in Burma

53. Arrival of Shanta Das (who persuaded Pamheiba to accept Ramanandi cult); departure of Gopal Das—Umanglais destroyed, meat eating banned; pig and poultry rearing banned in the capital; cremation introudced (_Kumbaba_); tombs of former kings opened, skeletons cremated, ashes immersed in Chindwin; puya meithaba? Lourembam Khongnangthaba objected but to no avail—adoption of names: Manipur, Maharaja; Gotras for Salais; all Hinduised Meiteis were declared Kshatriyas (was casteless society before); festivals renamed, Rajkumars introduced, Sati Burning introduced—excavated Ningthem Pukhri
54. Pamheiba pressured to make Chit Sai (son of third wife) king due to a promise to her?—Chit Sai had inferiority complex, was unpopular; ex-king and Shyam Sai (son of Pamheiba's first wife)—Chit Sai exiled Pamheiba, who sought shelter in Burma but returned only to be slaughtered by Chit Sai (thus became the first patrich in Meitei king history?)—Chit Sai tried to bring back traditional Sanamahi cult; persecuted Hindus—his patricide became well-known? fled; tried to gain British support but failed—Gourshyam (Shyam Shai' son) became king; Bhagyachandra (Gourshyam's younger brother) made prince—strong Burmese invasions followed who used British weapons; Meitei king and people fled
55. Gourshyam gave his throne to Bhagyachandra (also believed to jointly rule?) under agreement to rotate rule—Bhagya abdicated after a Brahmin was killed by his servant; to atone for—after Gourshyam's death, Bhagya king again—failure of Anglo-Manipur treaty; Khellei Nungnang Telheiba (Khellemba), seeing declining power of Meitei throne, invited Burmese to attack; Khellemba installed as king
56. Bhagya-Ahom friendship; Jai Singh (Bhagya) had to prove his heritage by catching a wild elephant? (because Khellemba wrote to Ahom king denouncing Bhagya)—Bhagya, disguising as Naga, visited Kabui tribes of western hills to gain info where he was known as Chingthangkhomba and very popular—Bhagya-Ahom invaded; dethroned and killed Khellemba; Bhagya king again—several Burmese invasions followed, Bhagya fled; Bhagya's war of liberation; at the end of Bhagya's reign, Manipur as unconquerable as in the beginning; Bhagya was more a liberator rather than a conqueror—extent of his kingdom same as Pamheiba's: bounded by Barak and Chindwin, north-south boundaries not very clear—capital cities frequently shifted: Sangaithel, Sangaibrow, Lammangdong, Langthabal (Kangla had been and was deserted for more than 30 years)
57. Bhagya installed Govindajee temples, statue of Krishna carved out of a jackfruit tree from Kaina; four images of Krishna at four different places—introduction of Ras Leela; blend of traditional Meitei dance forms and Vaisnavite theme—religious syncretism as Hinduism is modified and adapted to suit local tastes and ideas; Soraren identified as Indra, Nongpok Ningthou as Shiva, Panthoibi as Parvati, Wangbaren (water god) as Varuna

Chourajit and Ghambhir fled to Cachar
59. No manipuri king accepted suzerainty before (except Khellemba); Marjit beautified Kangla, constructed two lion-like animals at Kangla, dragon as state emblem (influenced by Burmese culture); tried to invade Cachar (to avenge the insult of Cachar's king), Cachar's king sought Chourajit and Gambhir's help; Manipuri forces lost enthusiasm when they learnt Chourajit and Gambhir were on the opposite side; Marjit's invasion was complete failure; however _Kumbaba_ recorded that it was successful
60. Encroachment in Kabaw Valley and refusal to pay homage to Burmese king who invaded and made successful conquest of Manipur; was a part of a bigger plan: to conquer all north east and Bengal, Burmese empire at its zenith—Marjit fled to Cachar; temporary reconciliation between the three brothers, they drove out Cachar king? offered the rule to British India in exchange for their help in regaining Manipur; declined as East India Company were following non-interference policy in north east—Cachar divided among three brothers, who later quarrelled; Gambhir occupied whole of Cachar
