### Introductory: The Land and People

1. Manipur's size changed according to monarch's power—present size almost fixed since controversial transfer of Kabaw Valley to Burma in 1834
2. Geography: mountainous green—all rivers flow north to south except Leimatak—tracks through mountain ranges for trade and migration of Indo-Mongoloid, Negrito and Dravidian and Caucasoids—lakes greatly reduced during 19th and 20th cen
3. Tibeto-Burmans, Indo-Aryans, sizeable section of Tai (Shans) came to Manipur from pre-historic times to present day—migrating people brought Stone Age—metal usage learned through trade with Upper Burma and Thailand
4. Trade with Yunan province of China—Manipur in constant contact with Indian, Tai and Chinese through trade—learned silk, silk worm rearing, brick making and gun power making from the Chinese
5. Several theories about Meitei origins—are not (descendants of) Aryans, but some Aryan elements among them—archaeological findings at Tharon cave points to existence of Mon-Khmer speaking Austroloid Mongoloid people who migrated here before the advent of Tibeto-Burman speakers; these Mon-Khmer elements absorbed by later immigrants—absorption of many Tai immigrants into Meitei society since 8th-cen AD
6. (T. C. Hodson) Meitei people alike Naga-Kuki of the hills—foreign invasions, Shan, Burmese, English and Hindu left a permanent mark, leading to Meitei civilization away from primitiveness
7. Meitei descendants of hill people?—same language family: Tibeto-Burman—close connection of Meitei clans with hill people in close vicinity—similarity of royal Meitei costumes with Naga tribes—similarity of architecture of Kangla halls with ritual houses of Naga tribes—Angom chronicles indicates Angom were in Ukhrul at some point of their migration—tradion of Meitei (Mangang) settlement in Koubru before moving into the valley
8. Naga: umbrella term for many tribes who all speak Tibeto-Burman—some Kuki tribes migrated to Manipur hills in pre-historic times along with or after the Meitei advent in the valley—more Kukis came 18th-cen onwards due to the great Kuki exodus—Pangals settled in Manipur since 17th-cen, adopted Meitei language—many Indian communities migrated at the end of 19th-cen: Bihari, Bengalis, Marwaris, Nepalis

### Sources of history

9. R. B. Pemberton (a young British officer)—volunteered to join guerilla force of Gambhir Singh in liberation movement to drive away the Burmese—later, represented Manipur as a commissioner in Kabaw Valley dispute with Burma—a pioneer of modern historical researches in Manipur—rejected Hindu origin of Meiteis
10. T. C. Hodson—his _Meitheis_ is still the best full scale study of Meiteis
11. P. Parijat (local writer)—wrote _Manipur Purabritta_, giving genealogy of rulers with chronology—proposed that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba might have ruled in 4th-cen AD and not from 33 AD
12. _Cheitharol Kumbaba_—royal chronicle, has three phases: from Pakhangba to 1484 AD (Kyamba's reign), from 1484 AD to 1780 AD (Bhagyachandra's reign), from 1780 AD to mid-20th-cen (Bodh Chandra's reign)—chronicle keeping began from 1484 during Kyamba's reign, hence first phase dealing with pre-Kyamba rulers is extremely sketchy but second phase is very detailed, reliable—chronicle was lost during multiple Burmese invasions during late 18th-cen, new chronicle re-written—the chronicle possibly has some biased views glorifying Meitei conquests—some history possibly excluded since the work was written under heavy eyes of the rulers?
13. Other chronicles exist—_Ningthourol Lambuba_, more detailed than _Cheitharol Kumbaba_ but has no chronology—individual clans also have own chronicles
