### Introductory: The Land and People

1. Manipur's size changed according to monarch's power—present size almost fixed since controversial transfer of Kabaw Valley to Burma in 1834
2. Geography: mountainous green—all rivers flow north to south except Leimatak—tracks through mountain ranges for trade and migration of Indo-Mongoloid, Negrito and Dravidian and Caucasoids—lakes greatly reduced during 19th and 20th cen
3. Tibeto-Burmans, Indo-Aryans, sizeable section of Tai (Shans) came to Manipur from pre-historic times to present day—migrating people brought Stone Age—metal usage learned through trade with Upper Burma and Thailand
4. Trade with Yunan province of China—Manipur in constant contact with Indian, Tai and Chinese through trade—learned silk, silk worm rearing, brick making and gun power making from the Chinese
5. Several theories about Meitei origins—are not (descendants of) Aryans, but some Aryan elements among them—archaeological findings at Tharon cave points to existence of Mon-Khmer speaking Austroloid Mongoloid people who migrated here before the advent of Tibeto-Burman speakers; these Mon-Khmer elements absorbed by later immigrants—absorption of many Tai immigrants into Meitei society since 8th-cen AD
6. (T. C. Hodson) Meitei people alike Naga-Kuki of the hills—foreign invasions, Shan, Burmese, English and Hindu left a permanent mark, leading to Meitei civilization away from primitiveness
7. Meitei descendants of hill people?—same language family: Tibeto-Burman—close connection of Meitei clans with hill people in close vicinity—similarity of royal Meitei costumes with Naga tribes—similarity of architecture of Kangla halls with ritual houses of Naga tribes—Angom chronicles indicates Angom were in Ukhrul at some point of their migration—tradition of Meitei (Mangang) settlement in Koubru before moving into the valley
8. Naga: umbrella term for many tribes who all speak Tibeto-Burman—some Kuki tribes migrated to Manipur hills in pre-historic times along with or after the Meitei advent in the valley—more Kukis came 18th-cen onwards due to the great Kuki exodus—Pangals settled in Manipur since 17th-cen, adopted Meitei language—many Indian communities migrated at the end of 19th-cen: Bihari, Bengalis, Marwaris, Nepalis

### Sources of history

9. R. B. Pemberton (a young British officer)—volunteered to join guerilla force of Gambhir Singh in liberation movement to drive away the Burmese—later, represented Manipur as a commissioner in Kabaw Valley dispute with Burma—a pioneer of modern historical researches in Manipur—rejected Hindu origin of Meiteis
10. T. C. Hodson—his _Meitheis_ is still the best full scale study of Meiteis
11. P. Parijat (local writer)—wrote _Manipur Purabritta_, giving genealogy of rulers with chronology—proposed that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba might have ruled in 4th-cen AD and not from 33 AD
12. _Cheitharol Kumbaba_—royal chronicle, has three phases: from Pakhangba to 1484 AD (Kyamba's reign), from 1484 AD to 1780 AD (Bhagyachandra's reign), from 1780 AD to mid-20th-cen (Bodh Chandra's reign)—chronicle keeping began from 1484 during Kyamba's reign, hence first phase dealing with pre-Kyamba rulers is extremely sketchy but second phase is very detailed, reliable—chronicle was lost during multiple Burmese invasions during late 18th-cen, new chronicle re-written under Bhagyachandra's order—the chronicle possibly has some biased views glorifying Meitei conquests—some history possibly excluded since the work was written under heavy eyes of the rulers?
13. Other chronicles exist—_Ningthourol Lambuba_, more detailed than _Cheitharol Kumbaba_ but has no chronology—individual clans also have own chronicles

### Prehistory and Proto-history

14. Evidence of Old Stone Age confined to the hills, but New Stone Age relics all over hills and valley—Manipur appears to have received Brone Age culture from Thailand and upper Burma—evidence of pleistocene men in Manipur dating back to about 30,000 BC
15. Tharon caves findings indicate Hoabinhian culture (of Southeast Asia, Vietnam), possibly of Proto-Austroloids occupying these caves before the advent of Tibeto-Burman speakers, proposed date 5000-4000 BC—
16. Napachik (hillock near a Meitei village at Wangoo) archaeological findings—materials dated 1450 BC found—modern pottery found, which has affinity with those of Neolithic culture of China—edge ground tools found, have affinity with those of caves of Thailand, Burma, Hoabinhian sites in Vietnam—tripod wares found, they are characteristic of Chinese neolithic culture
17. Likely sequence of events as per Napachik findings: while a culture (Austroloid) having affinity to Hoabinhian continued, a full neolithic culture (Tibeto-Burman?) equipped with more advanced tools having affinity to Chinese neolithic culture arrived at Napachik around 2000-1000 BC—Tibeto-Burman Mongoloid settled around 1000 BC
18. Myths abound concerning Meitei origins and early days—Atiya Sidaba, Leimarel Sidabi, Kuptreng (Sanamahi), Sentreng (Pakhangba) and many stories, versions surrounding them—King kangba; first recorded king (some sources say: Tangja Leela Pakhangba)—burial of the dead during King Tonkonba—continuation of long reign, then big flood in the valley, political vacuum till the emergence of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba

### Pakhangba and Foundation of Ningthouja Dynasty

19. Salai literally means ancestor-god of lineage (sa = sagei = lineage, lai = god)—clans were ethnic groups with own language/dialect and culture, occupying a territory
20. Geographical distribution of clans—Luwang, capital at Koubru foothills and later at Lammangdong—Khuman (who lived together with Luwang), separated, went southeast, capital originally at Thoubal, later shifted to Meikoipung (near Mayang Imphal)—Angom, migrated from Ukhrul, later supported Pakhangba to be the ruler of Kangla—Khaba, once very powerful, ruled Kangla before Pakhangba (whom they defeated), later defeated by Pakhangba ascending the throne, then were reduced to a mere social group and merged with Nganbas to form Kha-Nganba—Heiren Khunjam, village level politics, existence and struggle against Meitei kings several centuries after Pakhangba, orginally inhabitated south of Kakching, east of Moirang; later absorbed into different Salais—Sarang-Leisangthem (Chengleis), old ethnic groups, their earliest chiefs also ruled from Kangla at some point
21. Flood due to landslides caused by change of course of Leimatak?—valley people rushed to hills, some Angom became (merged with) Tangkhul?—when dried, people came down to the valley but no organised state at Kangla—political vacuum and anarchy; many ethnic groups struggled, sponsored candidates for throne of Kangla—Nongda Lairen Pakhangba emerged successful—mysteries and theories of Pakhangba's birth and origins
22. Legends concerning Poireiton—on a mission to colonise valley—traveled through Shans in Kabaw valley, tribes of Tengnoupal hills, then entered valley—contemporary of Pakhangba? rebelled against him for throne?
23. Pakhangba, who was supported by Puleiromba (chief of Angom), Luwang, Chakpas and other tribes, ascended the throne—later absorbed Moirang, Khuman and many other tribes into Meitei—seven clan system began, many developments followed, also imposed marriage rules?—departments created: Laipham Shanglen (court of justice), Naharup Shanglen, etc—horse hockey, umanglais (ancestors of villages) worshipped, Sahamahi-Pakhangba worship not started yet?—mysteries surrounding Pakhangba's death, but possibly killed by Khabas
24. Settlements of migrants during Pakhangba's time—led by different leaders: Poireiton, Arong, Thongaren; settled at different places—Thongaren's group became Naharup—Poireiton's group became Ahallup? Poireiton as progenitor of Luwang clan (W. Yumjao Singh)
25. Chronology of Pakhangba—reign started form 33 AD (_Kumbaba_), 374 AD (P. Parijat), 789 AD (pandits during Bhagyachandra's reign)—reign of over 100 years myth, reign of 12 years (according to Angom Gopi's _Pakhangba Nongkarol_, written during Pamheiba's reign)

### Evolution of the Meitei State

26. Khuiyoi Tompok (Pakhangba's son)—invention of drums, technical innovation in metallurgy
27. Taothingmang (Tompok's younger son)—dredging of Imphal and Iril rivers, helped by his brother Yoimongba—conquered Lokkha-Haokha (near Sugnu), first contact between the Ningthouja and hillmen recorded in _Kumbaba_—more kings came...
28. Naophangba—a religious leader from Bengal influenced him (the king) to adopt Hinduism?—stopped burial of the dead, introduced cremation, declared meat consumption taboo—but ultimately, king rejected the new religion?
29. Naothingkhong, runaway prince who came back to ascend the throne (under his mother's pleas) after a political anarchy of 5 years—poorly equipped, surrendered to Shamlung (invader from Pong) who, unlike other Burmese conquerers, did not commit any atrocities in Manipur, rather lifted the society, introduced change in clothing and food habits (women were completely naked before?)
30. Phayeng copper plate of King Khongtekcha—oldest Meitei script written inscribed inscription? deals with worship of Shiva and Devi by Khongtekcha—preachers of Hinduism must have been arriving in Manipur from time to time—mention of "Hari" implying worship of Vishnu—the authenticity of the finding doubtful, language adopted not as archaic as to be of 8th-cen AD—royalty did not embrace Vaishnavism before 18th-cen, but worship of Vishnu by Brahmin immigrants possibly existed in 15th-cen or before
31. By 12th-cen AD, Meitei state had handicrafts, weaving, maibas (shamans), artisans—continued to have conflict with Khuman (over encroachments of territory during hunting?) , Moirang, raided small tribes—Shans invaded, defeated Khumans; Meitei king Khumomba (1263-78) defeated Shans on the bank of Ikop lake, first victory against foreign invasion?
32. Ningthou Khomba (1432-67)—tricked Shans of Tamu, gained their support in his invasion of Moirang (first major defeat of Moirang), but Moirang continued to stay autonomous—his queen Linthoingambi outwitted the Tangkhuls who invaded Meitei in Khomba's absence, she raided/invaded and conquered several other tribes?—Kabaw Shans settled in valley, married Manipuri women, absorbed in Meitei society—Meitei, feudal system, almost a complete state except for Moirang's autonomy
